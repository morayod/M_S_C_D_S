__label__audio_quality __label__user_experience __label__support Great music service, the audio is high quality and the app is easy to use. Also very quick and friendly support.
__label__user_experience This app is super great. I give it five stars+
__label__advert This "Get the best Spotify experience on Android 12" advert is too annoying. Please let's get rid of this.
__label__bug __label__user_experience Really buggy and terrible to use as of recently
__label__bug __label__playlist  Dear Spotify, why do I get songs that I didn't put on my playlist??? And why do we have shuffle play?
__label__user_experience __label__bug The player controls sometimes disappear for no reason. App restart forgets what I was playing but fixes the issue.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience I love the selection and the lyrics are provided with the song you're listening to!
__label__support __label__bug __label__playlist Still extremely slow when changing storage to external.. I'm convinced this is done on purpose, Spotify knows of this issue and has done NOTHING to solve it! Over time I have changed storage options, each being faster in responsiveness. And please add "don't like song" so it will never appear again in my searches or playlists.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience It's a great app and the best mp3 music app I have ever used but there is one problem that, why can't we play some songs or find some songs? despite this the app is wonderful I recommend it. it's just the best.
__label__advert __label__account __label__subscription_or_cost I'm deleting this app, for the following reasons: This app now has a failing business model. Whether streaming services like it, or not: the consumer doesn't want to pay for music they can't fully own, and 6 ads successively, upon logging in, before a single song, is too much. Closed the app during ad number 6, and I'm more patient than most. If those are the only ways you can profit: you've already peaked. All that's left is your decline.
__label__podcast __label__bug __label__subscription_or_cost Love Spotify, and usually this app is the best, but as others have stated; the podcasts stop for no reason, which is only fixed by deleting and reinstalling the app. First world problems for sure, but highly annoying nonetheless, especially when paying for prime.
__label__connectivity __label__bug Can't play Spotify when on WiFi
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__comparison __label__connectivity __label__bug I had an Amazon Premium Music family package and it was good. Everyone could listen to whatever they liked on their respective devices with no problem. We now have a Spotify Premium family subscription and the connectivity is poor. It just doesn't work well. It stops playing all the time, and you can't use it on multiple devices at the same time. Why isn't the user experience better?
__label__connectivity __label__bug __label__bug Worst app always says I'm offline and never showed any song or podcast.
__label__song_selection I have any music that I like, it is superb.
__label__song_selection __label__comparison Improve the IA to recommend songs and it'll be the best music app, YouTube is better on that, on everything else, Spotify is the king!
__label__bug Android user - there are loads of glitches with this app... player bar disappears, shuffle button missing....sort it out please
__label__playlist __label__connectivity I can't listen to my DOWNLOADED playlist while I'm offline. So what's the point of this feature? Disappointed..
__label__user_experience __label__bug It always crashing down; unable to play and just stop working everytime I use it
__label__advert __label__user_experience __label__bug I know ads are the cost to free use And yes thats all right But 3 ads straight back to back Like for 1 and a hlaf minutes sometimes Don't you think that's a little much ? And even the volume increases just for the Ads.
__label__user_experience __label__subscription_or_cost This will always be my favorite platform to listen to music on. I don't like to subscribe to a lot of things, but this one is a must have.
__label__audio_quality His voice is so sweet and hearable.
__label__account __label__bug I logged out on my acc but when I tried to open it to log in, it won't open.. all I see is the logo
__label__user_experience __label__podcast __label__bug __label__subscription_or_cost Usually I love the app, but I'm having the same problems everyone else is reporting. Random pauses, stops playing and doesn't restart, and currently I can't view the song or podcast I'm currently playing so I can't pause or skip back and forth. It's fairly unusable at this stage which isn't acceptable for a paid service.
__label__user_experience An amazing music experience
__label__song_selection __label__advert __label__playlist Like that is has Everything I like to listen to. And with no commercial even better. Even the more like this are songs I've been wanting and not knowing the name brought some out! Thanks Spotify!
__label__song_selection JAMMIN' up in HYUH! Old school hardcore and thrash I haven't heard in years. Return to my youth? YES PLEASE !
__label__bug __label__connectivity cant listen to selected songs when offline
__label__connectivity __label__advert __label__song_selection Why this app show no internet available when both phone and wifi data is working. I already Fred up with adds now this happens all the time i want to search for song.
__label__user_experience Everything is perfect... Just Add Light Theme
__label__song_selection __label__playlist __label__user_experience No option to delete a song on an album. No option to download one track on an album and no option to shuffle all your music library without creating a playlist or liking ALL your music.
__label__user_experience The best music app ever I have seen
__label__account __label__bug __label__support __label__subscription_or_cost WOW!! ....all of a sudden my login doesn't work. Even though I'm 100% positive it is correct. This morning my app asks me to login? Why? This hasn't happened before, so obviously you are having some problems. Just found an email in my account telling me to change my password because of 'suspicious behaviour'.... yeah because logging into Spotify on my Xbox is suspicious!? Thanks for the stress this morning, didn't need that. I won't be renewing....my way of teaching you a lesson.
__label__user_experience __label__account Am unable to use on my ph .....it gets downloaded but unable to log in
__label__advert Plz remove ads because there are continuously 2 to 3 ads at least remove 2 ads and give 1 ad.
__label__connectivity Liked songs play offline, helps with signal problems
__label__playlist __label__bug Sometimes I try and listen to a Playlist and it will play the same first song and I try to go to a different one and it goes back to the same first one... little weird.
__label__song_selection Good app for listening to music..
__label__advert __label__connectivity __label__song_selection No commercials, and no ads no need for wifi it can use the song selection to pick up or at least that's how it looks.
__label__song_selection Wide range of songs collection
__label__comparison __label__song_selection __label__subscription_or_cost What's the deal here? Compared to the desktop version, this is inferior to it! Why is the ability to play any songs so bare or if not, barely free? Is there more that need to be said about this? I think I made my point clear enough!
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience Spotify is awesome! I love having any obscure artist I can think of at my fingertips as well as easy access to newer things! UPDATE: Lost a star for constantly asking for a review I've already done.
__label__user_experience Best app to stream music!
__label__account __label__bug My account was glitching so I logged out to try and fix it but now it won't let me log back in, it only shows the logo but never the sign in screen.
__label__bug Everything I go to open the app in the last week, there's no play bar, and now when I go to open it, it just shuts right back down.
__label__playlist __label__bug Lost download button. Can't download playlists.
__label__song_selection Love this app. The style of music selection is more specific.
__label__audio_quality __label__user_experience Pretty good apps for better quality musics
__label__user_experience the videoke feature doesn't show in my device until now
__label__user_experience __label__subscription_or_cost Love most of the features in the app but one thing is a bit expensive at each month subscription for $9.90.
__label__podcast __label__user_experience __label__advert Podcasts becoming a nightmare. Trying to get rid of podcasts on this app is ridiculous. Stupid things are all over the home page. You can click not interested till you're blue in the face and I'll just keep throwing up more spam casts.
__label__song_selection __label__podcast Best birthday present I have ever received from my baby brother! I listen to something at least everyday. So happy of the selection of Christian artists and music. Love finding new artists. Let just listening to great podcasts. Thank you so much for such a wonderful app!
__label__song_selection The only downside is they rotate songs in and out so one month you can listen to that great song next month maybe not.
__label__audio_quality __label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__support The audio quality is really good and I can listen to my favourite songs anytime and anywhere without any disturbance. That's really good experience 👍 I loved this app alot. Keep providing us the best support 👍👍
__label__bug Keeps cutting out and not showing what song is playing
__label__user_experience __label__comparison Very user-unfriendly compared to iPad and PC.
__label__subscription_or_cost As a subscription user, there is nothing I can say about Spotify. It is perfect.
__label__advert __label__song_selection __label__subscription_or_cost So much adverts like I get 6 ads before I start a song and you need a subscription just to play a song itself.
__label__user_experience Exceptional application for online songs. I loved the option of merging the app with inter music player of samsung. Overall, application works flows less.
__label__comparison Spotify is better than joox fosho
__label__advert __label__comparison __label__subscription_or_cost Since Disney started to pay for ads for Disney+, the subscription-free version of Spotify became useless because after 1 or 2 songs you get at least 2 ads, one or two from Disney+ and sometimes one more. I will change my review if I won't get so many ads.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience Why does it go from playing liked songs to songs that you haven't even looked at? That's why it's getting three stars.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience It's great for listening to your favorite artists.
__label__account __label__bug Trash app. Can't even log in via FB account.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection This app is incredible. It's very very good to use and I am enjoying my music everyday, every minute and every seconds. I love it.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection This app is so good and cool i am very interested in this app i loved it so much, I'm listening every day and night to a variety of songs. I fully support this app and I suggest trying this app and having fun with a wide selection of songs and I just say try it, try it now. If you are an army, a blink then this app is very good for you armies and blinks and today is a very special day for armies this is an army day. Love you armies, love you blinks and I am so happy with this app, try Spotify. Love you Spotify 😊😊😊😁😁😁😁.
__label__song_selection __label__playlist __label__user_experience It was good at first, but it wouldn't let me pick a song and forced me to listen to an entire playlist to get to my favorite song because there was a limit to song skipping. Why is the ability to skip songs being limited?
__label__user_experience __label__advert __label__song_selection I love it so much and I would rate it a 4 star, the problem is that there are constant ads, and the song selection feature near the lyrics doesn't seem to appear for me anymore.
__label__playlist __label__song_selection __label__bug would rate it 5. but whenever, i play something on my playlist it changes to a different song and not my playlist . i hope this gets fixed soon.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__playlist __label__bug Love the app... A few small issues though.. 1. I find a song and add to liked, then look for the same song and it takes me to a whole different playlist Please fix.
__label__advert Too much and too long ads.
__label__user_experience __label__bug I didn't really like the app. Whenever I play a song, it just plays a different one.
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__bug __label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__connectivity Had no issues with this app for years being a premium user but now really struggling with it. As someone else said before, there is now no player so can't skip, pause etc. Not sure if this is because I'm on a Samsung Galaxy? As it does come back briefly if I restart my phone 🤷‍♀️
__label__song_selection __label__audio_quality __label__connectivity __label__user_experience __label__playlist __label__bug Great song selection, amazing audio quality. However, I have problems everyday with casting to Google home, connection issues, and I lose control of the volume. I need to open the app to be able to change the volume which is an inconvenience. I also think there should be an option to 'shuffle all songs' rather than having to put them all Into a playlist, or 'like' every single song which is very time consuming. Making playlists could be easier too, selecting multiple albums at once for example.
__label__user_experience Just bring back the "shuffle all" albums option. 🤦🏾‍♂️
__label__audio_quality __label__song_selection __label__advert Quality sound and selection. But their ads are louder than the music sometimes.
__label__user_experience __label__bug It always stuck at black screen.
__label__audio_quality Great music quality
__label__advert __label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__bug I love to hear Advertisements 😌❤its so SATISFYING.... But Sometimes songs play and INTERRUPT the Advertisements 😔....i request to fix this problem.... So I can enjoy ads Peacefully.... Great App🙏😊
__label__user_experience First time user, so far easy enough to navigate.
__label__advert __label__subscription_or_cost I will give less than one star the app plays too many ads after each and every song. As I have not purchased the premium version, this gives too many ads, which irritate a lot in your mood.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection Awesome but some songs I can't find
__label__advert __label__song_selection __label__subscription_or_cost __label__user_experience I really like Spotify, I don't have problems with ads but song selection and limited skips is so annoying! I neither want to pay for Spotify premium subscription nor switch to another app, and this makes Spotify hard to use.
__label__user_experience __label__connectivity Work really well with Android Auto on those long drives home.
__label__user_experience Please turn off shuffle play!!!
__label__song_selection __label__playlist __label__user_experience It's good but when you want to play a song, they provide other songs to listen to instead of your selected track and sometimes when you're trying to get to your song, the navigation is limited. It has the same effect on the playlist, you can't enjoy your song without other songs interfering and especially adding songs you don't like to your playlist.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience In the middle of songs its pauses and then restarts the whole song. You have to go into the app and play the song again.
__label__bug __label__audio_quality __label__user_experience Very glitchy, audio randomly drops out or stops playing. Control bar disappears from the bottom of the screen and unable to pause, stop or skip audio without closing out of the app.
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__song_selection I hate this If i have Spotify free, I can only listen to half of the song on mobile, hate this f#$× u.
__label__user_experience __label__advert __label__comparison __label__subscription_or_cost I uninstalled this app because I don't have any use for it anymore and as soon as I did that, the ads for it appeared on YouTube videos Just how freaking desperate do you have to be to promote it this much Please buzz off
__label__podcast __label__account __label__subscription_or_cost I love Spotify, I listen more and more, music an podcasts. We have a premium account, it's worth every penny.
__label__song_selection __label__playlist __label__user_experience __label__comparison What the hell? I'm having the same issue as "The Patoto Man", minus random songs being added. I can't even choose any song at all that I want to play. I can't view them properly, I can't play them directly and it only starts a 10 second snippet of the song. I can't even listen to any music I want, and can't even have playlists play the music I want. And the big one, it all seems to just be a Samsung/ Google Play Store issue. I can play just fine on Apple mobile devices like iPads.
__label__account __label__bug This app is good but fix it, I can't sign in.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__playlist __label__subscription_or_cost Dude the app is good and all but just today I was using it and later in the day I check it and it won't let me play my playlist, and random songs are added to my playlist I can't even select a song I want to play I can only listen to it for a short period of time, and it says "you added" in your playlist and then bottom part says "we added" I don't know what to do I just want to listen to the full songs without random bots adding random songs that I don't even like and have any interest.
__label__song_selection I love Spotify just wish I can download music
__label__song_selection It's awesome and great music app
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection Works super well.... When it works... The app doesn't seem to want to load 3/4ths of the time. Ultra laggy. Locks up my phone occasionally... Makes no sense. Otherwise, features are plentiful and you can find most anything.
__label__song_selection __label__account __label__user_experience I can't even listen to my favorite songs bc of the shuffle and I tried different accounts and it doesn't even change even a little
__label__user_experience The load time is wonderful and very short and you don't have to wait long to hear the next best thing.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__bug __label__account I love listening to music (I use it as a coping mechanism), so I appreciate Spotify too. But, about 3 days ago (?), my Spotify wouldn't load, it would just stay on the Spotify logo screen. Tried installing it and uninstalling it for 5 times, restarted my phone 2 times, cleared the cache/data for about 8 times, and I still can't open it (also waited for an hour for it to load).
__label__playlist __label__user_experience __label__support Used to be good. It doesn't let me play my playlists, pause, stop, start, and go back a track from my phone (Samsung). I emailed Spotify and asked help from a member but nothing's working.
__label__user_experience __label__podcast __label__connectivity For an app that has been available for 8 years, the amount of issues I have is frustrating. Like some other say, it stops playing randomly while in the background, even though I allow background data use and all that. At times while running in the background, the app disappears from my toolbar and I have to open it independently, then I have no way to click on what is playing at the bottom so I must force close it.
__label__song_selection I really enjoy My Music life Nice App Thanks for Spotify
__label__user_experience __label__bug I can't open the app. It's been 2 days please fix this.
__label__bug It's not that bad but why can't i just directly play the song i pressed on?
__label__user_experience Love spotify great for all the family
__label__connectivity __label__support __label__account __label__bug This app worked well until v8.6.98.900, when trying to install newer versions of the app, my pioneer car system wouldn't connect with Spotify anymore. This means that I have to upgrade all my apps manually to be able to keep the last working version of their account. Hope Spotify will fix their connectivity issue soon.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__playlist I used to love this app, but I soon disliked it because it continues to play music and other songs that aren't on my playlists or my liked songs. I've turned off the option for it to do that (play similar Songs when your playlists end. Something like that), but it doesn't work. I don't recommend.
__label__user_experience Excellent music experience
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__user_experience This is an amazing app I use it all the time and it's very affordable. If you are looking for an app to lift your mood, Spotify is the one you go for.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__advert __label__comparison __label__subscription_or_cost Spotify has literally accounted for everything when it comes to your best music experience. It's so easy to use but there's still so many features and I honestly didn't realize how much I needed it until I got it. Would recommend above apple music as it's more aesthetically pleasing and has way better features. GET SPOTIFY!!! (I do have premium) but even with ads it's still good.
__label__bug Sometimes it is not working
__label__user_experience Very annoying and disturbing
__label__audio_quality Good audio play experience with spotify.
__label__song_selection The best song selection till now ...
__label__advert __label__subscription_or_cost I hate ads and they do send work 1 month free premium (super upp)
__label__advert __label__song_selection I have gotten 10 ads in a row trying to listen to a single song. The ads were longer then the song.
__label__user_experience __label__subscription_or_cost I have used this app for the last 2 years straight, always use premium, it's an essential
__label__user_experience __label__bug App stuck on loading black screen with Spotify logo, restarted, reinstalled, no luck! Using Note 20 ultra
__label__playlist __label__song_selection __label__user_experience 2022.07.08 Would like to be able to save queue as playlist. Would like to be able to scroll back in queue an arbitrary number of titles. When playlist is playing, be able to add songs to queue, rearrange playlist sequence, and "save changes to playlist?" prompt at end of playlist... 🤷‍♂️
__label__advert Worst app for music, so many ads.
__label__song_selection Best song app all over
__label__advert __label__song_selection __label__playlist __label__account __label__comparison I love 💓 this app . It has adverts but not that much, that's the reason. And you can choose your favorite songs. You can enjoy different playlists with little data usage. And compared to resso, it uses less data. So, I prefer Spotify.
__label__audio_quality Nice audio quality
__label__bug __label__user_experience Umm... Lately There is Auto Pausing Problem when the screen Locks Hope It Will Fix Soon
__label__song_selection Amazing songs and artists!!! Great app 10/10 review!!
__label__song_selection __label__playlist Not bad but not good. I wanted to listen to a song that I like but suddenly it played a different song. I tried adding my favorite songs to my playlist but it played a song that I did not add to my playlist. Well, that's okay.
__label__song_selection __label__bug __label__account __label__user_experience I absolutely love Spotify and I'm obsessed with music, but I only rated it 4 starts for a reason. Ok so basically my Spotify was doing this weird thing it like had only one song in all my playlist and literally nothing would play, and I had no idea how to fix. And whats weird is that it would work on my other devices with my Spotify account just not on my phone. So it might be my phone but idk. And another thing it does is it just randomly kicks me out of the app sometimes. Well thats all I have.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection I really love it my favorite thing about this app is the lyrics 😍 it's amazing I love singing along with my favorite songs 🎵 💕
__label__song_selection __label__playlist Best music app....best collections.....they will create playlists specially for you... I loved it best app ever.
__label__advert Nice app but the ads are very disturbing
__label__bug Stopped working this morning for some reason.
__label__account __label__user_experience __label__subscription_or_cost __label__bug How long will it take to fix the payment option. Being on the free plan is not a nice experience. I want to get back on Premium but its failed now for the 2nd month.
__label__user_experience This is a nice app, I love Spotify.
__label__user_experience __label__audio_quality __label__bug Having streaming trouble with new update. Skipping of audio and app crashes
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection Easy play, and all singers and songs I wanted is here.Thank you
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection It's an amazing app but if it has been an option to select songs it's completely fantastic.
__label__song_selection __label__playlist __label__user_experience __label__bug The recommendations are always for popular stuff no matter what you listen to. Worst recommendations of all time. There is little to no effort put into these. If you made a playlist exclusively with 90's Norwegian death metal this dumb app would trip over it's racing to suggest Island in the Sun by Weezer. The now playing bar only exists most of the time making it almost impossible to use without restarting your phone.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__audio_quality Best music app but spotify should include the dolby atmos and spatial audios
__label__user_experience The app is amazing.
__label__user_experience __label__support I can't open the app 😭 I've tried deleting it and restarting my phone someone help.
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__user_experience __label__bug For a pricey subscription the app should work the way it's expected to.. but unfortunately it no longer does... Experiencing issues with pause functionality, issues with displaying the current playing screen, and constant need to delete and reinstall the app. Also, there is no landscape mode availability despite waiting for this basic feature for literally years.
__label__user_experience __label__account I have used this app for a few years now, Love it so much.
__label__support NICE ONE THANKS FOR YOUR HELP AND support
__label__user_experience __label__bug Have the same issue as others... App keeps freezing and crashing. Is there something with the recent updates as the app plays and stops constantly?
__label__user_experience This is one of the best music app of all time it's amazing if I could do 3000 out of 100000 I would give it a 100000000000000
__label__user_experience __label__bug Please help me how do I fix this I can't open the app the logo is stuck in the screen, I tried restarting and reinstalling the app and it doesn't work. Fix this.
__label__advert All good but I don't like ads too much ads
__label__user_experience Love Spotify, it's the only way to go living remotely. Love it!!!
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__playlist __label__account It’s the best App I have ever used for listening music. There are numerous options, playlists and specially blends.Spotify really knows me well. It creates playlists by my favourite songs which is appreciated. Artist mix,genre mix,mood mix these are so good. I like using Spotify. But I wish there were a few more advantages for those who use a free account. For example skipping more than 6 songs.
__label__song_selection __label__playlist __label__user_experience So bad I just want my songs so when I made a new play list to get rid of all the songs they added it literally put 500 extra song I rate one or zero
__label__user_experience __label__connectivity The app is not working on moto g52 5g. The app opens and nothing happens it will be in opening app state only.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__subscription_or_cost Probably the best app I found in Play Store for music. I love every feature in this app and my opinion is that you must add calller tone and ringtone option in Spotify because Spotify have all songs and other apps don't so if you add this feature for paid subscribers it'll be amazing.
__label__advert A lot of ads come in this, after every two songs the ad comes, please remove the ad.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__audio_quality Love it but why did they add it where if I play the song on my tv they show a picture of the artist's profile picture as the background? I liked the solid color with the album cover in the corner better. I couldn't find a way to turn it off either. Love Mac DeMarco but it jumpscared me seeing his face out of nowhere. Need an option to take it off. Ruins the audio quality.
__label__song_selection __label__account __label__subscription_or_cost __label__user_experience __label__podcast __label__playlist This is absolutely ridiculous. I lost all my music, ended that subscription and account, made a whole new one with a new subscription and can't like songs, can't add podcasts or playlists. Severely unimpressed.
__label__song_selection I can find most songs I love but sometimes can't find older songs but love it none the less.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__playlist __label__subscription_or_cost It's a great user experience and my favorite, I'm sure you will like it too. However, one limitation is the restriction on the number of song selection per hour. I recommend using it, great for sharing songs with friends and the ability to create playlists are fantastic - I have one with over 50 songs!
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__song_selection __label__audio_quality __label__account Love it. Sadly you have to buy a subscription to fully enjoy the service. Love the blended mix between songs. Was told sound would be better when bought a subscription, but it's still the same.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__playlist It's a good application. When I'm searching for peace by listening song I can find it here.but I think it needs some improvements.. such as shuffle on off, playlist change,and many more.
__label__song_selection __label__advert __label__user_experience I like this app because of the wide variety of music, but a flaw to this app is the amount of ads during and after the music or podcast you listened to, and the 5 skips per hour. Other than that this is a good app.
__label__audio_quality __label__song_selection __label__advert __label__user_experience Best music app very good quality songs, they sometimes give 30mins without interruption, there are hundreds of not thousands of songs which are in high quality I really recommend downloading.
__label__user_experience __label__playlist Easy to operate and the playlist it matches up for me is spot on what I wanted to hear. 👍👍
__label__song_selection can't select anymore songs.
__label__song_selection __label__account __label__user_experience __label__connectivity __label__support This is so frustrating! For the past two weeks, songs have been stopping after just 1 second. 1 SECOND!?! Is this the service I'm paying for? I've tried several troubleshooting methods with Spotify, including logging out on all devices, changing my password, restarting my device, checking account settings, updating to the new version, reinstalling the app, verifying a strong internet connection, and clearing the cache. Despite this, the problem persists. I really like this app but if this continues, I might have to say goodbye.
__label__user_experience __label__advert __label__song_selection Very good and the exact app I was looking for. 1 star not given because of too many ads and some songs are not there.
__label__subscription_or_cost The golden standard. Get premium y'all. It's worth it.
__label__user_experience Always on time and on point.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience Great music. Easy to use. Amazing selection variety!
__label__user_experience __label__connectivity __label__song_selection __label__account Slowly getting worse, my Spotify has been getting super buggy. A lot of random pauses and disconnects with my Tacoma. Bugged so bad it started playing music without knowing it and I could not pause or pull up any screen that would allow me to pause the music. Had to restart my phone, a S10+.
__label__user_experience __label__advert __label__subscription_or_cost __label__account Like this app forever but the ads are disturbing 😐 pls take the ads if anyone not have any money what he will do he can't pay any premium so do like that everyone is there nowadays so pls make my demand and Spotify 4ever
__label__user_experience __label__bug Works well for the most part. Hangs occasionally with just a few bugs.
__label__user_experience __label__podcast __label__bug I have been using the app for podcasts, and I am enjoying it. However, sometimes the audio player does not appear when one transitions to a different podcast channel. To rectify this, I have to restart the app. Please address this issue.
__label__advert __label__user_experience Why i am getting hindhi ads, which i could hardly understand, can't even you make advertisement based on the region of user, based on location access?
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__bug It works for a little then after a while it doesn't. When pressing the play button for a song a whole different song plays something I've never heard before, or pressed on but it shows the song I've requested playing please fix this.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience The only thing I don't like is I can't pick the song I want to play and I can't change from shuffle play to just playing from the first song to the last
__label__song_selection Songs are again play after complete and need to give next track manually.
__label__user_experience __label__connectivity __label__bug I don't know whats going on with this app, but I'm encountering so many problems now. The player is not visible nearly all of the time which makes it VERY difficult. Never used to have these problems. Needs to be fixed for Android users.
__label__advert Too many advertisements are there.
__label__advert Too much ads its too irritating.
__label__user_experience __label__connectivity __label__bug This app is getting more and more annoying, I can't even open the thing, it's just getting stuck on the damn loading screen, I waited for hours last night seeing if it would load, but nope. Fix your damn app.
__label__bug __label__song_selection __label__playlist Last two updates have ruined the app. Turns off mod song and shuffle is stuck on. So frustrating.
__label__user_experience __label__bug __label__song_selection __label__subscription_or_cost This app is great in so many ways. But Jesus does it glitch. There's so many user experience issues that have been going on for months, even when you're offline but have downloaded songs, it loads very slow or doesn't at all. Extremely annoying when you pay for your subscription and it doesn't even function correctly. Please fix the bugs!!!!
__label__song_selection __label__connectivity Worst Everytime I open it I can't play any song It says no internet connection even when I am connected to internet. It only works when my phone is connected to WiFi. That's not good at all
__label__user_experience __label__subscription_or_cost They purposely throttle the app making it unbearable and a waste of time to use unless you have premium. Genuine disgusting business practice.
__label__playlist __label__song_selection I love this app but I wish we could have the option to turn off the "we added" part of MY playlist I don't want to listen to some random German song I can't understand when I'm trying to cry myself to sleep with really sad songs.
__label__song_selection Good app for listening music.
__label__song_selection When I put my songs on random like 2k songs. It always seems the same ones play. Been like this for a while.
__label__advert Awesome app but can reduce ads for free users
__label__user_experience It just open and crashes
__label__user_experience No super awesome on android
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__playlist Extremely Poorly Optimised. Autoplays the same song always, unintuitive navigation to artist album releases etc.
__label__user_experience __label__account __label__subscription_or_cost __label__bug I have deleted the app to reinstall it and now it will not launch anymore!! Have done the clear caches, clear data and force stopping, restarted my phone and reinstalling the app but none of them works.😭 I have a premium account and now I cannot even access it ! It gets stuck to the logo opening😐
__label__song_selection Best app to listen to music.
__label__song_selection Best Music Streaming App for Android and Ios. Provides Various songs to choose from based on person's personal recommendations.......
__label__song_selection __label__playlist __label__user_experience __label__account PREMIUM BUYERS: READ B4 U BUY Guys, the app's awesome. But: 1.There is no way to see all of the songs downloaded to ur phone. U can only see the playlists u've downloaded or partially downloaded. 2.The only way to clear space is to either delete all of ur songs or go playlist by playlist. If a song is on multiple playlists it won't delete. 3.You can't delete individual songs. This review is limited to 500 char. so I'm cut short. And offline mode is broken too. Dev email me for full report.
__label__user_experience __label__advert Amazing app just a decent amount of ads.
__label__user_experience Amazing and easy to use app, so good to use. 💜👀
__label__support __label__account __label__subscription_or_cost Customer Service is terrible. They don't answer emails back. No customer service phone number. No way to cancel subscription. Total Garbage. No help from them at all they just want the monthly subscription costs.
__label__song_selection Good app Good music
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__support I never seen this type of app it's worst app The app is not at all opening from first i didn't listen even one song also Pls solve this problem Spotify 👍🏻
__label__song_selection __label__playlist __label__bug WHEN I GO TO MY MUSIC IT KEEPS PUTING MUSIC THAT I DONT KNOW AND MUSIC THAT ARE NOT IN MY PLAYLIST LIKE FIX IT
__label__user_experience __label__bug I haven't used this app yet because it doesn't open when i press the app.. Spotify pls fix this.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__connectivity I was using the lite version then j installed this and i think that lite is better. The like button and skip are too close to each other, so it dislikes the song instead of skipping it and there is undo option for that u have search it again and also it crashes a lot. My phones literally telling me uninstall it because of the crashes. And sometimes the player also does not work and it does not have the feature of a background player like the lite version. I'm getting rid of this one, and getting the lite version.
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__advert I bought a 1-day premium subscription and still getting advertisements. What's the point of spending money on a premium subscription?
__label__bug Keeps crashing on my s22 ultra
__label__user_experience __label__connectivity Always had Spotify on my computer and now got it on my phone great to use doesn't take too long to open great.
__label__song_selection __label__subscription_or_cost So you mean to tell me that on order to listen to the songs that I WANT to on mobile and not some random song that will play instead, I am required to pay for Premium? Yeah, no. One star, and going back to YouTube.
__label__advert WAY too many ads, and it's always the same annoying 3. Ffs
__label__song_selection Best app for music lovers.
__label__user_experience brilliant as always
__label__user_experience __label__account __label__connectivity __label__user_experience App is extremely glitchy. Thought it was my phone and/or my poor internet but NOPE. After reading all these posts I see my experience is the same as others. So much for adding a Premium account, no thank you. 7/22 Pretty much the same as above. Still glitchy. Still no premium upgrade desired. Thanks though.👍
__label__song_selection __label__playlist I wish it would cycle through all the songs in a play list before playing a song I just heard.
__label__song_selection I hate Spotify it won't let me choose what I want type of music it sucksssss I hate I hate it I hate it!!!!! ;
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience Generally good. Lots of music I like. A few missing things. Don't want suggestions for Kanye etc. Why doesn't it suggest more appropriate tunes?
__label__song_selection That's too much. Why would I use a music app that doesn't allow me to choose the tracks I wanna play? I'm done with Spotify.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection I use this app multiple times daily. This might actually be my most used app. Spotify is amazing and has an extremely large collection of music.
__label__playlist __label__support __label__bug I can't see my playlists on the app. It kept saying that I need to add music and podcasts. I tried creating new playlists but it didn't appear on my library. Is this a bug? Please fix this.
__label__advert __label__song_selection __label__subscription_or_cost __label__comparison I have a love/hate relationship with this app. I don't mind the adverts, it's the fact that I can't choose what songs I want to listen to anymore. I only get previews of the songs. The restrictions on song selection are mostly for premium users. I'd rather pay for another streaming service. 2022 UPDATE: switched to another music platform, and my experience is so much better.
__label__playlist __label__song_selection Every time I play a playlist or press shuffle on a playlist. It gives me some random song I haven't heard of before or even want to hear. For example I was playing a star wars playlist and out of nowhere after the first song. It went to someone like drake
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__song_selection __label__playlist __label__user_experience I love my Spotify because... It has an "ad-free" option It keeps record of the different types of music, artist, and bands (from old to new school) that I like. Spotify makes me daily mixes to check out, which I love. Spotify= 10 ⭐ 🤩
__label__user_experience __label__bug Its been a week since I've got this problem where I can't open the app, it's just a black screen with the Spotify logo in the middle, please fix it as soon as possible, I really enjoy the app.
__label__song_selection __label__advert Select a song and get something else Ask for RHCP and get Limp Bizkit. i can deal with the dozens of ads but itd be nice to get the music you actually choose.
__label__connectivity __label__playlist __label__song_selection __label__bug Updates downloads when I need it most, I work in a manufacturing facility so it is very hard to get connection and I cant having my phone out too much on the floor. Its annoying to have to wait on it working and feel like my job is at risk cause my PRE DOWNLOADED PLAYLISTS need to re-download... SHUFFLE DOESNT WORK. PLAYS SAME 20 SONGS OUT OF A 40 HOUR PLAYLIST! FIX IT PLEASE!
__label__connectivity The app isn't optimized for low connection speeds and spotty connections.
__label__user_experience __label__bug Spotify as a platform is great. But the app for android is slow, glitch filled garbage.
__label__song_selection Love the selections do many to choose!!
__label__song_selection Thank you...you brought back the young girl in me! Love looking up the old music from the 80s
__label__user_experience Very hard to use compared to other platforms
__label__song_selection It just simply is using a different song to the one I select.
__label__song_selection I love Spotify. It plays great music on there.
__label__advert __label__playlist __label__user_experience I like it I still use and all but the ads bro so many ads like I pick a play list and literally over 6 ads go on then when it's say "enjoy the next 30 minutes without ads" its lying cuz and ad pops up when it hasn't even been 30 minutes but I like how it's set up and all so ima still use but bro the ads are over board
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__user_experience Downgrading to one star. Enjoy paying for a thing that doesn't work.
__label__song_selection Some songs are disabled though.
__label__user_experience __label__connectivity __label__support __label__account __label__bug I love this app so much. I have been using Spotify for like 4 years and it has rarely posed any problems. I had an issue with switching what device I was listening on but it was easily fixed. Just a suggestion of mine would be to add/make a remote feature or app so if people are listening on like a computer hooked to a TV they can control Spotify from a phone easier.
__label__podcast __label__user_experience Music and podcasts when I exercise, shower, cook, eat, whenever I want to feel upbeat, focused, or just want to listen to a great interview. Great app.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection I can't even open the app anymore I can't listen to music
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__bug __label__connectivity Hello, i facing a problem sometimes it turn off suddenly and no pop up when music was on. I have to keep install and uninstall this app, and it kinds annoyed me sometimes. Please fix this bug. I was using samsung a73 G.
__label__audio_quality Really good but it needs better sound quality
__label__song_selection __label__account __label__subscription_or_cost __label__playlist Best app for streaming the latest music hands down. If you have Spotify Duo you & your parter can create your own accounts & playlist for one small price. I absolutely love Spotify. Highly recommended.
__label__advert __label__song_selection __label__subscription_or_cost Decent service... Except that the free version is getting to the point that at least as much time listening to music is spent listening to ads! 😵 I get you want people to pay for Premium but it's truly ridiculous. Used to really like Spotify. Now I just turned it on, it played ONE song, and then LITERALLY at least 8 (I lost count) ads ranging from 15-45 seconds EACH. And not even the "Enjoy your next 30 mins of ad free listening" message so for all I know it'll be the same after the next song.
__label__account __label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__podcast __label__advert premium user for years. Spotify has always been my fav music & pod app but I'm thinking about switching. Never used to have any issues, 2 yrs ago I switched to iPhone for the first time - still no problems. Switched back to Samsung a few months ago, the app is almost impossible to use. You can almost never see 'now playing' to control your show or music. It randomly pauses your podcast for no reason. & It marks podcasts as played after 1 sec so you can't sort by unplayed. Also a million pop ups.
__label__connectivity __label__song_selection __label__subscription_or_cost __label__user_experience This app disconnects from the internet regularly for no reason. Can't set daughter's lullabies to ignore so guess what my most played songs and recommendations are? This app isn't cheap, I expect it to be far better.
__label__song_selection There is no search option for song.
__label__podcast __label__song_selection Best podcasts and music
__label__user_experience __label__account __label__bug It will open but I'm stuck at the sign in it won't do anything except show the logo
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience Best option for music. Everything you can think of is on Spotify. They provide song selections, offer a great user experience and give concert info.
__label__podcast __label__bug __label__user_experience Music and podcasts keep pausing for no reason. Also the playbar for whatever is playing (when it does decide to play) is mysteriously absent from the bottom of the app UI, and also absent from the pull down notification bar on my phone.
__label__song_selection __label__audio_quality The quantity of different types of music is fantastic although they quality can be poor at times
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience I am very impressed that when many of us requested the song selection feature be reinstated it actually was. I would provide a five-star rating but no one is perfect.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience This is the best song selection platform ever. This is the one to rule them all. As a person who enjoys music, I appreciate that this platform is also extremely user-friendly.
__label__song_selection __label__podcast Spotify is great! I love the idea of following up great music and podcasts.
__label__user_experience I really like this app. But it's been acting up lately.
__label__podcast __label__playlist __label__user_experience The app won't show the playlist I want to listen too whether that's a podcast or not the app says there is nothing in it or it will continually load for hours never ending. Note this has been happening to me for months.
__label__song_selection __label__bug __label__user_experience __label__connectivity Best music app BUT it crashes way too often and has some bugs, like play delays. Even on a brand new device with 8GB RAM. Please try optimize this.
__label__user_experience __label__support __label__user_experience I have trouble because I consider it a challenge to navigate without the "help" site! Otherwise I enjoy it !
__label__advert __label__subscription_or_cost Too many ads. It says ad free for 30 min, but the ads continue after 3 songs.
__label__user_experience __label__subscription_or_cost __label__bug Since the last update, my Spotify has been pausing frequently. It's very frustrating and makes my subscription a waste of money. Please fix it.
__label__user_experience Best app I just love the app really very nice app 😊😊 seriously love it
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience The best music selection and it's very easy to use
__label__comparison Apple music is worse. But better.
__label__song_selection __label__playlist __label__user_experience I love having MY music at my fingertips! I don't like when Spotify decides to add music to my playlists though. I know you can turn that feature off but it does it on its own sometimes. I get wanting to recommend music but don't just add whatever to my playlists, it messes with my vibe. 😉 Other than that this is a great app!! Thank you!
__label__bug __label__support Crashed & support doesn't give a damn. After contacting they gave up because every trouble shoot option they have DOES NO DIFFERENCE.
__label__song_selection Their Is so many amazing song an gonras that it so hard to pick 1 but thanks to Spotify I don't have to only pick 1 I can pick 5 and Spotify finds them and gives them to me
__label__user_experience __label__playlist I had a best experience with this app but as time goes it doesn't play my playlists anymore
__label__bug __label__user_experience __label__support This app is way to buggy for how big the company is and how long it's existed. Long load times, buttons fail to do anything. Continually having to speak to tech support. Avoid
__label__audio_quality __label__connectivity It lowers the volume to the point where it's very difficult to hear over the car radio. Very disappointing.
__label__podcast __label__bug __label__user_experience When I use this app for podcasts mostly, but it keeps stopping on its own and part where I can pause and rewind is not even coming up, to pause I have to close the app. When it works, it is a good app.
__label__song_selection So many songs there have only been a small handful I can't find or a certain version. Sometimes a song is taken off which sucks because it was the only one there. Up to 1561 songs and still climbing. Love it
__label__user_experience __label__account __label__support I love this app and I'm freaking out because I accidentally logged myself out of my account and when I went back on the app it just have spotify symbol in middle of screen and doesn't do anything... I've uninstalled the app 2 times and still nothing..
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection The app works really well but I hope you change the Romanised lyrics of Tamil into original. The Romanised lyrics of Tamil has a lot of spelling mistakes, so I hope you change that into original.
__label__advert __label__subscription_or_cost __label__song_selection __label__playlist __label__user_experience ads were never there and It should have stayed that way instead of chasing after sponsors and money they should stick with what they have bc all there doing is losing users. Not only are the ads unnecessary but the premium is ridiculous how are you going to tell me how many songs I can skip on my playlist, it's unthinkable and annoying. You can't rewind on the songs, restart or just simply even control your own playlist. My point is they could most definitely upgrade the app and make it more user friendly.
__label__playlist __label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__audio_quality Rn I am unable to pause, skip & play music in my spotify playlist. I usually had that bar that allows you to pause, play & skip to the next song when you minimize the spotify app to have music play in the background but its not there anymore. If I play a song from my playlist the next song in that playlist does not play for some reason. Or if I want to pause a song that is playing I'd have to close the app entirely. I have this problem whether I use my earbuds or not. I've never had this problem.
__label__advert __label__song_selection Just to listen to a couple of short ads, I get to listen to, what is arguably, the greatest Live Album ever: The Allman Brothers Live at the Fillmore East. It just doesn't get any better.
__label__playlist __label__user_experience Please provide an option to let us exit the playlist when we are not listening to music. It's extremely frustrating that all I can do is pause the music. It drains my battery as I have to let the app continue running when I'm not using it.
__label__bug __label__user_experience __label__song_selection App crashes, no now playing information. If it ain't broke don't fix it, latest update is garbage
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience Good free music. Easy to use.
__label__user_experience __label__bug Used to be good, getting worse. Buttons disappeared. Not happy
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__comparison I love Premium but $10/month is way too expensive considering Sirius is like $5/month. If Premium was $5/month like Sirius it would be absolutely worth it!!
__label__playlist __label__song_selection Excellent Playlist that they select in terms of Jazz.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection Great app easy to use and has everything I like to listen to
__label__bug __label__user_experience It bugs out every once in awhile but besides that its amazing.
__label__song_selection Good app for song selection
__label__playlist So far so good, I'm building a playlist, I'll let you know in the
__label__podcast Podcasts aren't available in my area. So annoying.
__label__song_selection Amazing App.. we have left song selection for you guys.
__label__advert __label__song_selection Too many commercials. Limited to skipping songs in playlist.
__label__song_selection __label__playlist Lots of song options and love the Playlist it puts together.
__label__audio_quality I really like the audio quality...hello everyone...have a nice day....😎😎😎 Stay safe...always god bless...🙏🙏🙏
__label__advert Great app. too many commercials.
__label__song_selection __label__podcast __label__bug Randomly stops when listening to music or podcasts. Quite annoying, missing Winamp more everyday.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__playlist __label__support To tell you the truth guys I preferred Spotify Stations it's easier to customize playlists based on the individual artists. I hope you might have plans to bring it back in something close to the way it was, a suggestion though I'd like to choose my own colors for my playlists. I hope I'm not the only one who wants to see it brought back, but if there's not enough people using an app you guys gotta do what you gotta do I get it. Thanx for listening.
__label__song_selection __label__advert None of the music actually plays. The ads do, but never the music.
__label__song_selection __label__advert __label__subscription_or_cost Good app, access to loads and loads of music, ads are annoying but every ad is like that but there is the option to pay for premium, overall I love this app
__label__podcast __label__song_selection __label__user_experience Great! Love the content! But it doesn't get 5 starts because the app can act up. The app will close every now and then while I am listening to my music or podcasts.
__label__song_selection __label__playlist I don't like when I search a song; that it doesn't let me listen right away. It puts the song in a "playlist" that I don't want to hear.
__label__advert __label__user_experience __label__playlist Spotify was fine, I never paid to remove the ads because I don't mind them. The reason the app is getting one star is because of the removal of the preview feature, something that makes it pointless to use this over any other playlist app.
__label__user_experience __label__advert App performance is good but one thing which make this app not good is a lot of Ads and it is soo irritating so I am disliking it
__label__podcast __label__bug __label__user_experience __label__support Breaking up often (typically every each 9-10 seconds) skipping 2-3 seconds. Extremely annoying. Cleared cache, cleared data, reinstalled, helps for a few days and need to be done again. Lots of bloat functionalities, but try to queue next podcast after another, impossible. Home menu living its own odd life, favourites as well. Looking at blog nobody is doing anything for ever green bugs, sad.
__label__song_selection I love the music on it and you can play your favorite songs I wish you play your own music of you choose.
__label__song_selection Best music software yet
__label__bug __label__subscription_or_cost __label__support __label__comparison Re-download app because i was having issues and now the app won't even open. Just stays stuck on the spotify symbol. It's more of an issue because I'm paying for premium and I can't even use it! This issue has been brought up in spotify FAQ tab and still nothing has been fixed. Very disappointed. Had to download pandora in the meantime.
__label__user_experience Awesome and amazing.
__label__song_selection I love all the songs & artists on this app
__label__podcast __label__playlist __label__user_experience __label__song_selection Edit: The SD Card trick from online forum works. App is working as intended. Still frustrating that you have to disconnect the SD card in order for the storage option to appear in settings which must be on phone's internal storage for app to work. Mobile app does not work. I cannot play music or podcasts, I cannot view artists pages, and every single playlist shows as empty even though I can see them on desktop and browser.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__subscription_or_cost __label__bug __label__support Not sure what's happened with this app. But it skips my songs all the time, just like a CD. I uninstalled/reinstalled and even in between got a new phone. Absolutely NO DIFFERENCE. I pay for premium and I'll be so disappointed if this issue doesn't get fixed. It used to be my favorite for music...unfortunately no longer. Very frustrated.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__bug Spotify has definitely improved a lot since I started using it a couple years ago. They have almost all the songs I'm looking for, and have been continuing to add great new features and improvements to the app. Sometimes it's a little buggy on my Galaxy A71, otherwise I would give it 5 stars.
__label__user_experience __label__bug __label__subscription_or_cost __label__podcast __label__playlist Not great to navigate, and it keeps screwing up to the point where I have to uninstall and reinstall it because it forgets that it's playing my podcast and gets rid of the controls. For $8 a month I can get my content elsewhere, it doesn't even intuitively bring up the next podcast I should be listening to.
__label__song_selection __label__connectivity __label__subscription_or_cost Great app great access to music but I wish you could listen to songs without wifi without getting premium.
__label__user_experience __label__connectivity App suddenly stopped working on my Android.
__label__song_selection I never knew about this app till a friend introduced me to it, I can choose whatever I want all thanks to my friend SPOTIFY is the best thing ever that could have happened to me
__label__song_selection Excellent music variety.
__label__song_selection __label__advert __label__subscription_or_cost __label__playlist I would give this a 0 star if possible, I used spotify a lot back in the day. Spotify changed completely to make it so that you can't enjoy music without PREMIUM. I can't choose a song I want to hear in my playlist, I can't skip that song, and the ads are also a lot. Spotify, you're so bad now. Not all of us can afford premium. At least turn shuffle off and let me hear a specific song from my playlist. Please. That's all I want.
__label__song_selection Good , you can get all songs even the remixes.
__label__user_experience __label__bug I love this app but I had to uninstall then reinstall but everytime I open the app it just stays on the logo tried 3 times it's not working
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection I am here downloading this app so that I can change my alarm ringtone.
__label__user_experience The main problem for me it's the absence of Belarusian language. It would be great to use the app in my lang.
__label__user_experience __label__connectivity So far so good but hard to control on my car system but I'm sure that can be tweaked to perfection..👍🏽
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__account Brilliant I just love the great selection of artists and the fact you get 14 days abroad was so nice when I recently went to Spain and could chill out listening to my favourite songs and so relaxing. Thank you Spotify.
__label__song_selection __label__playlist Spotify is the best way to listen to music on mobile or tablet. Search for any track, artist or album and listen for free. Make and share playlists. Build your biggest, best ever music collection. Get inspired with personal recommendations, and readym
__label__user_experience Yall are getting rid of the voice feature and I'm disappointed
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__account __label__comparison I am very disappointed, I listen to spotify all the time and am completely tired of stupid suggested songs, I even put on yhe blocker in settings and it still doesnt work!! I WANT TO LISTEN TO MY OWN SONGS!!!!! Not popular songs everyone else likes. I AM GOING TO TRY OTHER COMPANIES, BECAUSE I SURE AS HECK HATE THIS ONE!!
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience Music is stopping out of nowhere and I'm starting to get more annoyed about it.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience Update 7-8-22: The shuffle is busted. Plays only what you recently discovered and spinned a lot. This rule is counter intuitive to what people expect from a shuffle.
__label__user_experience My experience with Spotify is just great! Thank you Spotify for everyday.
__label__user_experience __label__connectivity All of a sudden the app will not work on my S22+
__label__user_experience __label__connectivity Initially i liked this application but Why the hell it doesn't work on my wifi it only works on my mobile data
__label__song_selection __label__connectivity Wonderful can have your song selection played in the automobile over connectivity fantastic.
__label__song_selection I have had this app for a short while, I really like it a lot, I can't wait to have all my songs where I want. I recommend it. Thank you. Di
__label__comparison __label__user_experience __label__podcast __label__playlist __label__account I hated iheartradio, so I am trying this. It is an improvement over iheart so far. However, some things could be streamlined better. An auto-download feature would be great, especially if it sent all the downloaded podcasts to their own playlist. The ability to reorder a playlist or library should be an option. Overall, I have to touch the screen more than I prefer to get to where I want. Updated 7/8/22: new updates have reduced this app to hot garbage.
__label__audio_quality __label__subscription_or_cost __label__song_selection __label__playlist __label__account Nice app, but when your free trial is over, the quality really goes down, if i search a song it gives me some random person's playlist, and i can't skip to the song i like. Nice app, but only the premium version.
__label__user_experience __label__subscription_or_cost __label__song_selection The new update is just horrible I don't like the fact that I NEED TO PAY TO LISTEN TO WHAT I LIKE it's absolutely infuriating and the offline update? You never did it unless you go back to the old update then the one star is all you get.
__label__user_experience I have a unique way of expressing enthusiasm. Translated, it means I really enjoy it. Absolutely love it!
__label__user_experience __label__bug Would be great if it actually worked. I'm having issues with this app at least 50% of the time.
__label__song_selection __label__playlist __label__user_experience In my opinion the add more songs feature is really unhelpful no matter how many playlists I make it recommends the same songs over and over and I don't even mind them and the genres they recommend are completely unrelated to what I listen to. I think they should add a feature where you can dislike a song or hide it, so it doesn't get recommended to you again, but where you can still search it up or view it in a folder just in case.
__label__bug __label__support __label__account __label__user_experience The app is so glitchy on Android that it won't let me play any music on my phone. It's been this way for 2 months now, and at the worst time (while I was on a road trip and needed tunes). And no customer support number to help me fix it...What am I paying for exactly? Going to try to get refunded, maybe I'll sign up again if they fix the app.
__label__user_experience __label__support It's actually not that bad to us upcoming artistes so download it bro it's awesome take it from me Lil Tentacion 6ix rich.
__label__user_experience Thank you Spotify!
__label__comparison it's been more than two years that I've switched to Spotify from YouTube music, I can not live without it now.
__label__user_experience __label__advert Actually it's good, but the ads when you're enjoying but the ads.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__connectivity Been using spotify for ooo 6 or 7 years... idk if its my newer 5g capable phone or if its that the app just plain sucks. But it does suck. Currently trying to play music over wifi and its saying i dont have an internet connection 🙃
__label__song_selection when you search for a specific song and you press play, why does the app play a completely different song?
__label__podcast __label__connectivity __label__playlist __label__account __label__user_experience __label__bug A great resource for music and podcasts, BUT constantly deciding to randomly stop or start, podcasts are a pain to connect - need to have a new episodes playlist that works. I'm paying for this! You need a more user-friendly function, and to fix all the issues with Android auto.
__label__song_selection __label__support __label__subscription_or_cost __label__user_experience def one of the best music apps while supporting the artist of the songs you play, premium is the apex <3 if ever, its really helpful to be able to play a song by picking for free users, leaving the download for premium ^^ also user experience for mobile pls !!
__label__user_experience __label__connectivity Easy to use, never has any problems.
__label__song_selection __label__account __label__support always something with this app. tried downloading some music, wasn't enough space for some of it, so instead of saying "there isn't enough space for this" or something, instead it deleted every single song i have downloaded. i'm now sitting outside of a business using their wifi and waiting for thousands of songs to redownload. frustrating
__label__audio_quality __label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__subscription_or_cost __label__bug Hi spotify when I listen to my favorite songs, I'm getting poor play back quality. The songs are freezing right in the middle of the song. And it's not just one song, it's doing it every time I listen to the app. I tried Un installing the app, then opening it up again but no difference. I won't need to continue Spotify premium, hopefully this gets fixed so I can come back to enjoy my songs.
__label__bug __label__song_selection __label__connectivity There are some bugs to work out with the Bluetooth pairing when it comes to this app knowing where to play the sound. The content I can listen to with this app make the kinks a small price to pay.
__label__user_experience This app is good but having a little problem.
__label__podcast __label__bug __label__user_experience __label__audio_quality __label__support PLEASE FIX THIS BROKEN APP. Every time my Samsung Galaxy has an update, the Spotify app breaks and I can't control for audio that is playing. It just plays, without control, until I cost the app.
__label__song_selection __label__audio_quality Good song selection, shame the app pays for good audio quality
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__playlist Trash, hard to choose song. Kinda confused. Sometime the apps just shuffle the song. I just need one
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__connectivity __label__subscription_or_cost The user experience is great but I cannot search for any new song/artist as I am stuck with 'No internet connection available' on a high speed WiFi connection. Tried every trick available on the internet to no avail. I'm a Premium subscriber FYI.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__bug __label__subscription_or_cost This app needs major improvements. Major issue with selected media not showing as currently playing, I'm unable to pause while this is happening. Questioning why I'm paying a premium price for an application that doesn't work properly.
__label__user_experience __label__bug __label__song_selection __label__playlist Love the app in general, but lately there's been a lot of glitches: I can't queue anything properly, quick action bar disappears sometimes, it even stops playing on its own. I'm up to-date on the updates, restarting the app or my phone doesn't help...
__label__podcast __label__user_experience Once again the "now playing" menu is gone making it impossible to pause or resume a song or podcast without force closing and restarting the app. This is on OxygenOS 12.1
__label__user_experience __label__account It's a great app but I'm having an issue trying to log in because the app isn't loading idk. If it's my phone or the app itself
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection The bar with the currently played music doesn't come up making me unable to start/stop the music.
__label__account __label__subscription_or_cost __label__support Got logged out of my account that still has premium and I don't know what email I used. Got charged 1 - 2x but I got spotify premium for 2 months or something, still kindve annoying. Still have me free premium with the same card.
__label__song_selection Love how every song I like.
__label__user_experience __label__support Usually works fine, but now it keeps closing as soon as I open it. I've tried reinstalling it and restarting my phone, but it won't open.
__label__advert Good but too much ads
__label__user_experience __label__playlist __label__song_selection __label__subscription_or_cost I absolutely LOVE my user experience with this app! I have the ability to make my own awesome playlists (which I can add ANY song that plays from ANY station and/or other playlist). I also appreciate how the app creates a playlist for me based off of what music I listen to and like in the app. There is definitely a HUGE variety of different songs and types of music/podcasts to listen to and it's ALL 100% FREE! However, the ONLY thing I really dislike about the app is that I am not able to search specific songs.
__label__account __label__song_selection If offline mode was available for the normal version of Spotify like you could save some artists who you like and play their songs
__label__playlist __label__song_selection For some odd reason it is keep playing random songs when ever I try to listen to my playlist
__label__song_selection Very bad. Can't preview song.
__label__song_selection I can find all the music I want to listen to and new music also
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection Worst app I ever used. Having 2GB of mobile data but still can't access any song.
__label__advert Great app but should reduce ads
__label__song_selection __label__subscription_or_cost my downloaded song are removed after my subscription had ended. very bad policy.
__label__user_experience Great but slows down my phone.
__label__song_selection Thee best music platform ever🔥🔥🔥❤
__label__user_experience __label__playlist __label__comparison __label__advert This is a good app but the main downside to it is the point that we can't listen to our playlists and songs in the order we want, PC and Mac is the exception which allows all of the above but still have ads.
__label__user_experience __label__connectivity I used to love this app but it's become unusable as of late on Android.
__label__advert __label__subscription_or_cost The ads are ridiculous. Yes, I know you can pay for the app and the ads go away but I don't have extra money for a subscription.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience Great song selection service, been using it since 2015/16 and never had any problems, straightforward and user friendly!
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience Spotify is the best music app No doubt about it. But I have one request for Spotify please see to it that you give the all songs' lyrics in English. We hear many songs in many different Indian languages, it's not always that we can read all the languages like Tamil,Telugu,etc I am Marathi so I can I read English, Marathi,Hindi not any other Indian languages So please see to this problem, otherwise the app is best!
__label__account __label__bug __label__user_experience I logged out of my Spotify account to log in too my friends for a brief second, but as soon as I logged out Spotify has been broken. I've been met with nothing but a grey screen with the Spotify logo. I closed in and out. I waited over night, still didn't work. This morning I deleted it then re-downloaded it. AND IT STILL ISN'T WORKING??
__label__bug __label__podcast __label__account I don't like how it bugs every once and a while like when I really need it to work. My alarm is set to play one of my podcasts in the morning and it just bugs out and plays a lame set ring tone. I don't like how it makes me log out and log back in for it to work again.
__label__audio_quality __label__subscription_or_cost Nice audio quality but should try to provide better quality without additional charges.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection For some reason the widget on my home screen quit working and it no longer allows me to skip or play again from my lock screen?
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__user_experience __label__playlist So far it has been a good experience. Decided to become a paid member. Long commutes make this app a must. Love how I can make my own personal playlist with songs I want.
__label__song_selection Best app for music listening!!
__label__song_selection Amazing app.....loved it...just sometimes I'm not able to find some of the songs cover....it would be great if u look into that
__label__song_selection __label__subscription_or_cost Always great song and at a fair price!!
__label__song_selection Best music provider.
__label__song_selection __label__audio_quality __label__user_experience I've had this app for almost 5 years.. That is the free version and the paid version. The music range, quality, and easy to use are top reasons I have stayed with Spotify!
__label__comparison Spotify is the best
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__connectivity __label__user_experience __label__support I already subscribed to your spotify premium and still not working or opening to my device. I already emailed that I was having a hard time opening your app. Please fix spotify
__label__user_experience __label__playlist easy app and keeps making new playlists for me. I enjoy it a lot.
__label__advert __label__song_selection Because this app has so many ads and also some songs are not available.
__label__support __label__bug __label__subscription_or_cost __label__account Complete garbage. They have no support team. Most buggy, nonfunctional app I have ever used. Free version might be worth it but do not give them money. They just cash it in instead of developing.
__label__user_experience __label__bug Horrible interface with tons of bugs.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__bug __label__song_selection __label__account The app was perfect when I downloaded it.It was very fun to use.After somedays of using it shuffles the song automatically.And it plays random songs that I don't want to hear.I can't play the song that I want to listen.It was a great app.But after this problem started I am getting irritated.And I tried to redownload it.And it still has the issue. So I don't even wanted to give a star.Just the problem nothing else.
__label__song_selection Awesome music awesome app 😎✨💚🐏
__label__song_selection __label__podcast I love to listen to the music and podcasts.
__label__user_experience __label__podcast __label__subscription_or_cost __label__song_selection I don't want to see "shows to try" or "episodes for you" podcasts first in the front page. I really dislike the recommendations, often grotesque and straight up unamusing, so I would never, ever use Spotify to listen to podcasts. I don't pay premium for letting you shove those horrible shows at the beginning of the front page, I'm paying to have my MUSIC ad free.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__support The app was so easy to use and the selection of songs fit my taste in music I recommend it to anyone looking for the songs of your choice
__label__song_selection When it come to music I really love to use this application very much good 👍
__label__audio_quality __label__song_selection __label__user_experience It provides best audio quality than any other app, as it is more essential for good music experience. It has millions of songs and podcasts. So just enjoy listening music on Spotify. 😉☺
__label__song_selection Enjoy listening to my favourite old songs
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__advert __label__song_selection I've been paying for my premium only for me not to enjoy ad-free and download, really disappointed.
__label__connectivity __label__user_experience __label__support __label__song_selection __label__podcast Let me stop autoplay when connecting to car bluetooth! It's not accessible. I want to hear my GPS without having to pause playback multiple times. Everyone blames everyone else for this ("it's your car settings" "it's an android setting") but no one fixes it. Google apps can toggle "allow external devices to start playback" but that doesn't fix Spotify. Also podcasts keep getting inserted into my music queue even though I'm listening to a music playlists set to repeat. Keep them separate.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience I'm sick of it, Spotify, please stop adding songs to Play lists. I get. You want us to try something new but it's getting annoying.
__label__user_experience __label__connectivity __label__account I don't know what is wrong with the app, it was fine till I updated my phone software. It is okay if I listening through my laptop, I think the trouble was not my account but the app itself. I rely on Spotify to listening music. I hope I can still use the app by phone since I use the app most of the time in it.
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__user_experience The app requires updates too frequently. For the cost it should be more reliable.
__label__user_experience Love my Spotify App!!
__label__comparison Made a switch to Amazon Music, completely unsatisfactory, it was like a downgrade when compared to this.
__label__song_selection __label__playlist __label__user_experience I like this app very much, but MY ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT: I THINK IT'S VERY STUPID THAT YOU HAVE TO SKIP TO YOUR FAVORITE SONG AND ALSO THAT YOUR SONG THAT YOU SEARCH IS SHUFFLED WITH OTHER SONGS!!!!!!
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__bug I am a die hard Spotify fan... but with the new update. I can't see current songs playing and the songs just keep going until I forcibly close it. Kinda sucks.
__label__user_experience __label__playlist Personalized listening experiences, I love the collaborative playlists!
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience Rubbish I don't know if it updated or something but you can't play a specific song anymore
__label__advert Not much interested, getting lots of advertisements
__label__account __label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__playlist Edited: Reading through the reviews, just wondering has this company been sold to a venture capitalist? Everyone's mad at u guys. I'm sorry, I usually don't do this, but I have to edit my excellent rating I gave this app. Last few days have just been really bad. Right now I can't see my currently playing song. My queued up songs and that's making it difficult to use the app. Kindly correct this and I'm happy to return my previous excellent rating. Thanks . . . . . . Simply awesome 😊👌🏿
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection Love Spotify generally, but reading reviews I've been suffering a problem that many others are experiencing. User interface disappearing, not allowing me to pause etc, also affects pausing my song selection. Music keeps stopping on its own accord. It is so frustrating!!!
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__advert __label__song_selection __label__playlist __label__bug Horrible push towards subscription cost, nothing but continuous adverts one after each and every song played. Very limited song selection, and now it won't let me skip or it makes my song selection change without me touching it. (As of July 2022) makes previously private playlists public, can't delete old playlists no matter how often I press the button, constantly exiting out of the app, just awful.
__label__comparison __label__song_selection __label__user_experience Computer version is much better and has a repeating option. On phone app it doesn't work. You can pick the song you wanna hear instead of random, unlike the app
__label__connectivity __label__user_experience __label__account There are sooo many problems with Spotify, maybe because I use an android but it keeps on saying that there are connection problems and not letting me access anything, please find a way to allow other android users to make full use of this app.
__label__connectivity __label__support I am facing issue with the app as my wifi and data everything is working it still shows you are offline everytime. I tried troubleshooting but nothing happens.
__label__user_experience my favourite music streaming platform!
__label__song_selection Love it. Great song selection, very extensive library found a lot of my favorites.
__label__song_selection __label__comparison Much more reliable than Amazon Prime Music and a far bigger choice of music
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__audio_quality So much good music app good performance and my favourite song is Sigma.
__label__advert __label__user_experience The ads are disturbing but the overall experience is nice
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__bug My dudes i love you but i now cant listen to music when my phones locked. Please fix and ill change rating
__label__podcast __label__user_experience __label__connectivity Terrible experience for listening to podcasts, it never remembers last played position of a podcast, it doesn't sync between devices..i.e. my computer and phone.
__label__user_experience __label__bug __label__song_selection __label__support __label__podcast Laggy, not as good as it was previous versions. I'm not a fan of the new changes, plus it won't let access songs when I'm offline, when half the time I'm just on cellular. Edit: still having the same problems since may 2022...why have none of the updates fixed these basic problems? I've mostly switched to a different podcast player, but still looking for a good alternative song player.
__label__podcast __label__bug __label__user_experience Updated rating 7/8/22: the app has become unreliable. Podcasts stop for no apparent reason, especially when screen becomes idle. I installed the app on a different phone with a bigger memory, but this app still stops. Fix your damn app, Spotify.
__label__song_selection Excellent app - can find almost anything
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__subscription_or_cost __label__advert It's a great app for listening to music, I have playlists I've made as profile Cheetah345 with probably thousands of songs. I have few complaints other than the fact that premium is just expensive enough that as a teenager with not much income I can't afford to spend that much. Unfortunately, the advertisements push a political agenda that I am sick of. Every time I listen nowadays, every single ad is for pro gay messages. I don't want ads for that. It's gotten so bad I can't even use this app anymore.
__label__song_selection __label__playlist I build lists of the music I love and explore new music without limits. This is my best music buy in years.
__label__user_experience Me and my daughter love Spotify it's one of our most used apps
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience I really like this app I can find music I haven't heard in decades man I can listen for hours thanks for having a damn good app
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__bug Play bat keeps disappearing. can't pause/play or change the song. Sometimes it won't even play a song after selecting it multiple times. Constantly freezing, can't even pause with my headphones when that happens. I have to completely close the app and restart it for it to start working.
__label__advert Such a rubbish app lots of adverts i m going to uninstall this app ..
__label__advert __label__song_selection Just had to sit through 6 ads straight as a free user only to it to play a completely different song than the one I clicked on.
__label__subscription_or_cost This app is a god damn mess. I pay for glinches apparently.
__label__user_experience __label__connectivity It's not even starting. it only shows the spotify logo. Am I only suppose to see logo in this app??
__label__podcast __label__user_experience Just recently started to randomly stop playing music or podcasts. Would have to go back into app to press play again.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience Every time I want to listen to my favorite songs, I can only listen to a few before it unexpectedly changes to a completely different song.
__label__bug When are they going to fix the broken download/offline working of Spotify.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection Great 👍 and I look forward to your new song selection, and the improved user experience 😀 👍 😄 😊 🙌
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__bug I found this app was interesting. Easy to use... Urge to improve: I use song selections as full screen, then I switched on another app. When songs changed, I switched back. The playlist screen turn to error, keep showing previous selection.
__label__song_selection Could not function with my music! Great app
__label__user_experience Best music streaming app ever! 👌👏
__label__song_selection Great app brilliant music the best
__label__song_selection It's a very nice app...with interesting songs🥰🥰just try it.
__label__user_experience I'm new to this Spotify and I really like it.
__label__bug __label__user_experience Always there are bugs and it always exits the app when I lock my screen.
__label__comparison __label__song_selection Other music apps have a feature where they allow you to download certain songs for free but this is not the case here.
__label__user_experience __label__support SPC 3008roblox Yes we can do that for you and the family have car Roblox I have to be in touch with you to see what you look and see what I have a few questions about your free time to get a new phone and I will be there in touch to let you can get a hold of the sky is not a good
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection Works great. And actually helps me find new artist.
__label__user_experience __label__bug The latest update ruined it. Crashes, controls disappear, won't switch to online after offline, and more.
__label__song_selection __label__podcast I love Spotify. I can find anything I want to listen to. They have any genre I want or if I want a podcast they have it!
__label__playlist __label__song_selection The App is amazing but the newest update has been quite Annoying. When I'm trying to play my playlist it always goes to some recommended songs which I can't skip.
__label__user_experience __label__bug __label__song_selection __label__playlist I love this app, but if feels like it will never improve... sometimes it just glitches and refuses to play and you have to exist and enter again... if you try to listen at the same time with friends there's a delay between when you hear the song and they do... even to this day they haven't brought listening activity to mobile... like just have it as a tab that you can open if you want to... there are so many things they could add, but they just don't... such a shame...
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience Very good app with all genres and eras of music. Gave 4 stars not because there is an issue, just that there is always room for some unknown improvement.
__label__audio_quality Omg 😍😍my fav app ever. It has really good quality💋🥂
__label__audio_quality __label__song_selection __label__comparison Clearly, this is an amazing app with the best quality, the only thing I don't like is that they don't offer all songs, but most every app has this situation or maybe a worse one. So please, ditch your Pandora and join Spotify, it is so worth it.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection I have lost the ability to pause and skip songs on the app.
__label__song_selection My favorite app for music 100%
__label__user_experience __label__bug __label__song_selection Been using it for years. Never had any problems. Pretty good library.
__label__song_selection I really love to listen to my music I love
__label__song_selection I enjoy every music from Spotify
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection Does the touch of my hand work? I can't change the song? An annoying app.
__label__song_selection __label__subscription_or_cost __label__account Great app find all songs I like and new ones but tired of being double charged for the premium package about to uninstall
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__bug It's a very good app for music...loved it a lot.. but today when I'm trying to open the app it's not working even after reinstallation, it's still not opening. Please fix the glitch.
__label__song_selection This is a fantastic app for old and new song selection.
__label__user_experience The 'What's playing' facility has disappeared. The most basic feature - gone. Not good enough.
__label__song_selection I love your music ..thank you so much for sharing this ,great job..
__label__user_experience Excellent music app
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__bug __label__connectivity Works but feels rough and glitchy. Unbelievable that such a big brand like Spotify cannot make an app that's well integrated with a premium Android device. This should be a top tier title. I'm using GalaxyS20 and constantly have issues with simple stuff. Like pausing the music or controlling the app through Galaxy Buds. Often freezes and music stays playing in the background with no way of turning it off other than hard closing the app. Android Auto experience is even worse.
__label__podcast __label__bug __label__connectivity __label__user_experience Thanks for dumping all my playlists without even telling me! Appreciate that! I also love how when I don't have connectivity, you won't let me play the podcasts that I already downloaded. I also love how as time goes on the more glitches and unreliability the app becomes. Thanks for letting me down, Spotify!
__label__podcast __label__connectivity __label__bug Not happy with the hey Spotify thing. I don't like it taking away my control while I'm in a vehicle.....or maybe this is just a bug.
__label__account __label__subscription_or_cost Love Spotify, and usually this app is the best, but I can't log in after using it on a flight with my family premium plan. I have tried deleting and reinstalling the app three times, but it still won't work.
__label__song_selection __label__advert Lots of good music but lots of adds
__label__bug __label__support __label__user_experience __label__song_selection Continually plagued by problems. Currently, it abruptly stops playing. My experience with Spotify made me feel that it doesn't necessarily value customers as the issues tend to remain unresolved for an extended period. It's reassuring to learn that it wasn't just my device causing the problem since I just switched to S22 ultra and the issues with liked song filters that I've reported numerous times are still persisting.
__label__song_selection __label__podcast __label__user_experience __label__bug The music options are great, podcasts are great, but functionally it doesn't work half the time. You play a song and there is a bug that causes the app not to show the pause and play buttons. They don't reappear until I restart my phone. Have to force close the app to stop playing anything. Can't skip any songs. Really an app breaking bug.
__label__comparison __label__song_selection __label__subscription_or_cost __label__advert Better than the other radio station offered. I like that you can select your music. I have the premium account with no adverts, great option.
__label__user_experience This app is great, if you are reading this you definitely need to download it.
__label__song_selection __label__account __label__bug Still garbage. If I wasn't so deep into creating my library using Spotify I would use a different app. Constantly have to redownload everything for absolutely no discernable reason. App closed and reopened? Guess you're downloading your entire library for the third time this week.
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__account I prefer free because it always drives me crazy when I'm choosing a payment method, whether it's through the wallet or a service provider, it's all the same...
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection I'm giving this two stars for no other reason that Spotify intentionally screws over desktop users by denying them important features which are ONLY on the app. Why can't I block artists on desktop? Why force me to use the app? I'd use it anyway, but making me HAVE to is just kinda butts.
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__user_experience __label__comparison I pay money for this every month and it is garbage. I've loved Spotify for years. Now they can't get it right. I'm seriously about to end my subscription and switch.
__label__account __label__comparison This is a paid app, do not install it. Wink and Gana are better options.
__label__connectivity doesn't go past the loading page
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__advert __label__song_selection The free trial is great and when thats over there are only a few adverts that come between you and your music.😁😊👌🤌🤟👍
__label__song_selection WOW MANY SONG DJ, ROCK, ROMANTIC, WOW THIS IS SO SUPER APP
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__playlist __label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__comparison I've been using YouTube Music for 3 years but a few days ago I bought Spotify premium edition to see which one is better. To be honest, Spotify has better playlists and thus a better song selection to discover new songs you may like. However, YouTube Music has a feature that mixes songs for you, but it changes every week which makes it less consistent than Spotify. However, the user experience on YouTube Music is better in terms of the app's design. If you don't want to spend money on a music app, the free edition of YouTube Music is a better comparison.
__label__audio_quality __label__user_experience Worst audio quality in the market. It's more a social network, if you really like music this is not your app.
__label__song_selection Everything's fine about Spotify but the song selection often repeats tracks. Please improve song selection.
__label__connectivity Very poor when offline
__label__song_selection This app is the best music app I have ever seen but there are some covers which are not here like "Sure thing" by BLACKPINK and "Clarity" by Jisoo...Pls update those in the app...other then this everything is awesome ❤️❤️❤️
__label__song_selection I used this and it was the best app for music
__label__user_experience __label__audio_quality Crashes on android everytime I go full screen. I thought this was a mature app? Where is quality control?
__label__user_experience __label__bug __label__song_selection __label__comparison App is terrible. It always errors out, crashes, fails to display a toggle bar for whatever you are listening to in order to pause or skip ahead. How can such a big company have such an awful platform.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__account It's easy to save and play my favorite tunes. I have been able to hear and save everything that I requested to listen to.
__label__account App is good but had a lot of trouble logging in once logged out.
__label__user_experience __label__advert __label__song_selection __label__connectivity I've been using Spotify since I first started using a phone. I can bear with the ads and everything but for some reason recently the music would just stop when I went to other apps and I'd have to start the song from the beginning again. It happened a couple times and I thought that it's okay but it's been happening so much recently its really getting on my nerves.
__label__advert __label__user_experience Ads are more. I am not interested in this app. I am deleting it.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection Love using Spotify for whatever I like to listen to. Everything about it is AMAZING!! NO faults.
__label__song_selection Spotify continues to surprise me with the depth of music available - always uplifts my day!
__label__podcast __label__playlist __label__user_experience __label__bug Love the app, have had it for years, but I just got a new phone (Galaxy S22), and since then when I use Spotify, my queue doesn't pop up when I start listening, I can't pause or go back and forward in any podcast or song/playlist. Obviously this is annoying if you want to check how long is left on a podcast or song, or missed something that was said now can't hear again without starting over, or worse needing to pause for a variety of reasons. Please fix
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection User friendly and makes good suggestions
__label__song_selection __label__support __label__comparison __label__advert __label__subscription_or_cost Highly Recommended. Mostly all the songs available, but, I wish there was some sort of thing in which we could request the songs we wanted to have but, overall it's actually way more better than any other music streaming app I've ever used. The ads are just a misconception. The ads are never TOO MUCH or back to back. They come occasionally which I guess is pretty tolerable for anyone who's not using the premium. Keep up with the good job.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection Easy to use able to find the music I enjoy
__label__account __label__user_experience __label__support The app will not even open anymore. I logged out and since then it stays at the loading screen. I've tried reinstalling the app, restarting my phone, even tried waiting it out. Nothing. Just a big logo that never goes away.
__label__podcast __label__song_selection Good application for listening music and podcast
__label__song_selection It's a fun app, lots of song selection.
__label__user_experience __label__podcast __label__subscription_or_cost I am seriously considering looking for another music streaming app. For weeks player keeps vanishing. Can't control this app, pause or stop playing. It's not a free application. This is ridiculous.
__label__comparison __label__user_experience __label__playlist This is a very good service for laptops and desktops but the problems arising due to newer updates are totally ruining the experience for mobile users. The feature that was present before, allowing a song to be added directly to a playlist is no more. Now, one must play the song before adding it to the playlist because the three dots option disappeared. Also, there's no option for mobile users to rearrange the songs on a playlist. Please resolve these issues ASAP.
__label__comparison Spotify is 10000%best i really love it !! Best app
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience Just let me view the creators songs not recommended songs. It's so annoying.
__label__user_experience An offline version should be developed, Meanwhile the app is nice, appreciated.
__label__advert __label__user_experience There is a 30 second advertisement after each song and it is very irritating.
__label__advert Cut the ads Good ...........🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__playlist __label__song_selection __label__account WAYYY to restricting! This app annoys me because its literally Forcing me to buy premium. I shuffle in my playlist and it plays a completely different song i havent put in my playlist Its so annoying that i have to shuffle in order to get the song i want to play cause if i click a song, it doesn't even play it. I dont even get the song i wanna play! I only get 6 skips per hour and the updates they make are a HUGGEEE downgrade. Im done with this app.
__label__podcast __label__user_experience I only really use this app for podcasts. I still don't understand why it will stop my current episode and then go to a random one. It's very annoying, happens daily.
__label__user_experience __label__advert __label__subscription_or_cost __label__account Need a mental piece of mind but this app would let me. The ads are pretty annoying, talks about Spotify premium all the time like I would purchase. If I did then it will be over my dead body. Deleting the app. Sayonara #crapapp
__label__song_selection The suggestion according to my mood is amazing.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__account It did work at first then after a bit it started to play up I tried uninstalling it and installing it again and again and it still wouldn't work I really enjoy the app its just playing up so I just stopped using it.
__label__song_selection __label__audio_quality Best streaming online music app.
__label__bug __label__user_experience I don't know if a bug or not u can open the app but just the logo that u can see I bin waiting for hours bat I can't go to the app
__label__user_experience Queue does not work, it seems it only queues the last song you added to the queue.
__label__user_experience __label__bug Recently the app just seems to randomly stop and start playback. Often I have to restart the app because none of the playback tools work (it seems to be stuck on playing something) and this playback continues across everything else.
__label__podcast __label__bug __label__user_experience this app is useless! so many times listening a podcasts and suddenly stopped and can't play it back until restart my phone and so many other issues that u don't expect from a company that big shame on you spotify really.
__label__song_selection It gives me a different song instead of playing what I wanted.
__label__bug __label__song_selection This app sucks because of the bug. Please fix it, when I tried to play something the song was incorrect.
__label__connectivity Application isn't working with wifi
__label__playlist __label__song_selection __label__subscription_or_cost __label__advert Love this app!! It is the absolute best streaming service!! It allows you to create your own playlist and will provide one for you based on your preferences. It has a vast variety of music including the oldies, 80's, 90's and many genres. Lets you discover artists without hidden costs and agendas!! And absolutely no adverts which makes me extremely happy!!
__label__user_experience Love Spotify, it's the best.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection broken app, no more 30 mins of uninterrupted listening
__label__song_selection __label__playlist __label__user_experience __label__audio_quality I hate that i can't listen to what I want. I can't choose a song, and I have to wait and listen to the whole playlist to hear song i want. I also hate limited skips and how Spotify itself puts songs on my playlists. The sound quality is really good but you have to fix somethings.
__label__advert __label__song_selection ads more than songs
__label__user_experience __label__advert __label__subscription_or_cost __label__song_selection Its a good app for music but the ads 😅 they are very annoying 😡 but I just bought a premium membership just a request give download option for free users.
__label__user_experience __label__advert Really a superb app but i give only 3 stars because there are one advertisement at a single song.so kindly avoid it
__label__song_selection __label__advert it always playing a few songs and 3 ads, and I don't know why
__label__user_experience Awesome experience on Spotify!
__label__user_experience __label__connectivity __label__podcast Add ability to better control volume when playing to Alexa speaker groups with multiple echos devices. Stop paying for Joe Rogans misinformation.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience Good until you plays the song I didn't like. Can't even switch to other song.
__label__user_experience __label__bug i just downloaded and it's stuck on the screen with the logo. fix this please! I haven't even logged on :'(
__label__user_experience __label__bug __label__playlist __label__song_selection Love the app, always have. However, it's been nothing but issues recently. The "now playing" info doesn't show. So I can't pause or skip music. It also stops randomly and I have to close the app and go back in and press play again to start over the playlist since I can't just continue with no "now playing" bar.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience This update is horrible when I select the music I want, it plays a random song. Please revert to the older version and let people enjoy their music in peace!
__label__song_selection Excellent app for music lovers
__label__user_experience __label__account I open the app just wont load so I can login why is that ?
__label__user_experience __label__account __label__subscription_or_cost __label__support I am a paid subscriber and have been using Android OS for >12 years; I know all the tricks. I cannot control the app or terminate a group session - none of the controls are working, even after stopping it from the OS app manager, clearing cache and data, and re-signing in. Unacceptable for a paid app.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__subscription_or_cost Overall the app is pretty good except that it's a bit confusing on a device other than a laptop. I also don't like how it doesn't allow you to choose what song you want to play from your playlist and you only get to hear a snippet of the song. Please change this because it comes to a very big disadvantage for people who do not wish to subscribe to premium.
__label__account __label__subscription_or_cost __label__support Hi there, I have uninstall this app in my handphone and i have check play store there is also no spotify app in my account.. Why do i still have to pay for the subscription fees? Able to assist please. Thank you.
__label__song_selection __label__subscription_or_cost Best music app so far. I am a premium customer.
__label__support __label__user_experience __label__bug After the update, Spotify doesn't load. It is stuck on the logo. I hope there is an immediate response regarding this issue. Thank you.
__label__user_experience I love Spotify! I use this app everyday!🥰
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__account I don't understand how to use Spotify now! I preferred the old version. Why did you change it? I wouldn't recommend downloading it. If I could, I would give zero stars! I'm not happy with these changes. Please revert it back because when I want to play music, the song I select won't play! I enjoy songs but I'm very displeased with Spotify for now.
__label__advert Bad due to ads at several times.
__label__advert Too too too much ads.
__label__advert Whenever I hear an ad on Spotify I vow I will never use that product
__label__user_experience Absolutely excellent,I love it. It's just my acception.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__advert Love it. You guys have built an excellent app. Moving music with new features would the next. Tesla would proudly be your sponsor. Congrats
__label__user_experience Good, Superb & Excellent music app
__label__song_selection __label__subscription_or_cost __label__user_experience Can't listen to songs offline, you need premium, other then that it's good.
__label__song_selection Same songs keep repeating
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection Spotify music app is very useful to attract people makes them for relation and happy. 🎤🎻🎹🎧🇨🇳🧧👘🐉
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__connectivity Normally would've given this app 5 stars but I didn't because of the following reason: -Apps are supposed to be better than the web version but not with this app. The shuffle option is very frustrating to deal with when you just want to listen to one song on mobile. You'll have to go through multiple songs just to listen to the one song you wanted to listen to. What doesn't make sense is why I don't have this issue on my tablet but I do on my phone. Can't loop either. Please fix this issue.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection Easier to use than Pandora for sure, the skip limit on here is bigger too
__label__account __label__connectivity I have downloaded this app about three times now and I can just log in or sign up..it keeps telling me am offline or try again even though I have strong network connection... This is not good at all
__label__user_experience __label__bug Randomly stops playing and doesn't show the controls at the top bar. Very glitchy in the last year.
__label__account __label__bug __label__subscription_or_cost __label__comparison __label__support Hello I'm currently having an issue where I couldn't log into my spotify. I don't even know what the problem is but the screen become all black whenever I open the Spotify app. I enjoy using Spotify so much and I open it everyday. I even subscribe to the premium plan. However, now I cannot use this Spotify and I chose to use the Lite version. PLEASE fix this problem for me :'(
__label__playlist Awesome love the app and enjoy the playlists
__label__user_experience __label__subscription_or_cost Nice apps, but too expensive to get the premium
__label__bug __label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__comparison Extremely glitchy and buggy. Never had an issue until last week. It will not let me pause music, go forward to the next song, fast forward, rewind and will not open the media player. I have no control. Debating switching to Apple music.
__label__user_experience __label__bug __label__audio_quality __label__song_selection Very easy interface and not glitchy at all work great in old device but the songs don't have high bass. at some point there is no bass at where it should be other than great app
__label__advert __label__song_selection __label__user_experience 1 minute ad after every 2 songs (sometimes even 1 song) it's unacceptable! To be specific, 2 Disney+ ads, each of 30 seconds. And it's July, stop putting Christmas songs in Daily Mixes! What's wrong with you people?!? 🙄
__label__user_experience __label__bug This app isn't working on my phone. I redownloaded the app but it's still broken. I don't know what happened.
__label__song_selection Love the app Like my choices to listening to my favorites
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__bug THIS IS THE BEST USER EXPERIENCE EVER though before when I downloaded Spotify and I selected a song, it plays a different song, which was actually frustrating. This made me move to YouTube but I came back again and the issue was resolved :D However, this problem might still exist for others, so I would recommend addressing that potential bug.
__label__audio_quality __label__advert __label__song_selection This app has gone from good to worse I listen to one song and I get 5 to 6 advertisements at a time it's ridiculous nobody should download this app anymore
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__user_experience It was good, but I think the Spotify duo package is somewhat unnecessary. I find the requirement to live in the same house quite restrictive for a duo subscription. It might make sense for families, but not all couples live or consistently stay in the same house.
__label__song_selection __label__advert One of the best app to listen to music And personally I have listings to ads inbetween :)
__label__connectivity __label__song_selection __label__bug __label__user_experience It's not opening up I have tried many times some days ago when I used to search for a song it would show no network but my network was all fine 😞 then I reinstalled the app but now it's not opening up at all it used to work all perfect but now don't know what happened pls ans me ??????
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__playlist You can't do a lot on your phone. I was trying to listen to my favorites and it wouldn't let me. You can also not revert to the previous song.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__subscription_or_cost __label__comparison Pathetic experience !!!!! I uninstalled this app after 1 or 2 weeks only.. you can't even play the music of your own choice, and you cannot even change the music when u want! I mean wth???! They charge for everything... You have to pay for everything , huh, Lol... There are easy and free alternatives, i mean why would we use this app and pay for it...
__label__user_experience What's there to not love about Spotify?
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience Hello! I am 50 years young, and I came from a very poor family background, grew up in the country, so we, (of course),...didn't have the money to just go out and buy new technology like some people. (70s-80s), That being said, ....anyone that can relate to this review?,....,probably had to save their allowance for a couple of weeks to go buy vynl records....etc.BOTTOM LINE!...Spotify on any smartphone beats! The old vynl when you couldn't afford to do that and keep your music too! THANKS!
__label__user_experience Excellent condition and very good apps
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection Excellent condition and very good apps
__label__user_experience __label__support I can't open my Spotify, it only shows the logo once I click the app. It's almost a week now; I hope this will get fixed.
__label__user_experience __label__connectivity Easy to navigate & share between devices. But it doesn't always play videos.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection This app is really good but sometimes there are not lyrics :(
__label__user_experience __label__connectivity __label__bug Latest version has major issues on pixel 6. Now playing no longer works only way to stop is to force close the app. Virtually unusable. How can I roll back?
__label__song_selection __label__subscription_or_cost Amazing app just wish we could download songs without a premium subscription.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__bug when I request for a particular album it won't play all the songs there it will just play like 5 in the albulm and start playing songs I didn't request for but of the same artist and also since I updated the app I if I search for a particular song I can't play it immediately I have too b listening to songs dat are of different artist or the same artist sometimes b4 it plays d requested song, I am tired of the app already.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__bug Usually love Spotify, but for as long as I can remember the app randomly stops playing a song then anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes I will start playing again... Does this at least 5-10 times per song.... Infuriating... Especially when you're having a sing along in the car and the song randomly stops playing... And you're not a great singer.... Please fix!
__label__song_selection I really love Spotify music
__label__playlist __label__song_selection __label__user_experience Whenever I make a playlist, that means I want to listen to the songs I put there. Not random songs that Spotify give me and don't even let me skip.
__label__advert __label__subscription_or_cost __label__song_selection Always loved spotify, I pay for the no ads subscription. My life without music would suck and spotify gives me the joy
__label__user_experience Great user experience so far.
__label__bug __label__podcast __label__user_experience __label__support Super buggy since the last update: doesnt show whats playing, pauses randomly, wont let me change podcast episodes, and to fix it I uninstall it and the problems come back within an episode or two. This needs to be fixed or I'll have to switch to a different podcast service because its becoming unusable.
__label__user_experience Great app! Surprisingly Amazing!
__label__advert So manyyyy ads 😐😐
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection Spotify is the best app I ever used. I feel that Spotify is connected with my soul and heart. Whatever my mood is, Spotify plays that type of songs for me. I love Spotify.
__label__song_selection __label__subscription_or_cost Honestly it's the worst music app that I've ever had on my phone it plays every song except yours you bacicaly have to have premium or you can't listen to your own songs
__label__advert too much advertising during listning songs 😬
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__account __label__song_selection They are really good and they also have a premium plan for 4.99 I use the family plan spotify has every song you would like.
__label__user_experience Spotify is awesome
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection Easy to use.. and all the song selection is almost available.
__label__audio_quality Good for listening on headphones!
__label__user_experience Please change back the old insta story design, the new bold font design is so ugly. At least let us choose what design we want when sharing to insta story.
__label__bug __label__song_selection __label__user_experience This last update completely destroyed the app. Why do you keep adding pointless things that aren't needed? It's breaking the foundation of the app. When I play music now, it doesn't show up at the bottom of the screen or on my lock screen, it's like I never even played the song. And then after 10 minutes it just cuts out for no reason and I have to go back to the app. I can't even listen to music for no reason. Sort it out
__label__song_selection __label__audio_quality Selections of songs & sounds crispy 👌
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__subscription_or_cost __label__playlist This app frustrated me to the point that I cried. I want a SPECIFIC song, and I click the song only to get fifty that I either hate, or are completely unrelated. I have to wait for hours to skip to that song because I'm not paying for premium. You should at least be able to pick a certain song in a playlist, and please get rid of the random bots messing with your playlist, it basically says "your playlist is the worst" to your face. I made the playlist to get a specific song dude, stop!
__label__song_selection __label__playlist __label__user_experience Omg this new update where everything is changed, I can't select an individual song off an album or any of my playlists. This update needs to be better or completely vanish.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__support Love the app, only wish it had playback speed like YouTube has, a good few songs that I have sound a lot better at a certain speed. How this could get fixed in the next update please and thank you.
__label__playlist __label__user_experience I would love an option to rename playlists on android mobile.
__label__song_selection __label__playlist __label__bug __label__comparison I used to be able to make playlists and get previews of songs suggested to me but they got rid of that like how am I supposed to know what song it is seriously y'all need to fix this because if it isn't fixed soon I'm going to use a different app this is ridiculous.
__label__user_experience Can't turn off shuffle
__label__user_experience __label__comparison __label__support __label__subscription_or_cost Was great until a few weeks ago? Have used the app for years but now keeps crashing every time I open on desktop? Have tried just about every suggestion available to fix - nothing helps. Am about to cancel my subscription.
__label__user_experience __label__account Amazing, until hacked. But thats life I guess
__label__podcast __label__user_experience My player stopped working with the app I'll play a podcast and it stopped please fix asap
__label__account __label__subscription_or_cost Can't figure out how to sign in to my family plan and merge both Spotify's
__label__song_selection __label__audio_quality __label__user_experience the best music library streaming app ever. please DO NOT break it here we are, 2022. it's broken. the audio quality used to be good, now it's a laugh. lyrics incomplete and wrong...
__label__playlist __label__song_selection __label__bug Great app! I can listen to Deftones sure! Only problem which has just occurred for some reason is where it keeps playing random songs? Like I'm trying to play my Playlist and then after the top first song it plays another song that was never added to my liked songs? Never played it on Spotify either. If this problem can be fixed please! And I mean please fix this!!
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__connectivity __label__audio_quality I have the premium version, I like it but when I'm connecting my JBL speaker the sound is interrupted and it's not great sounding.
__label__user_experience __label__connectivity App stability is getting worse, happens across multiple devices very frustrating.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__support Well I loved it at 1st... Then after trouble I had to contact you guys... 1st few times was good then the last few times I was wondering if the folks I was talking to even had a clue... after being told twice I would have to manually download my whole list of songs again I threatened to terminate... Then decided to try one more time and was able to get all my songs back with ZERO HELP FROM YOUR TECH SUPPORT... I'm still in the fence about leaving...
__label__song_selection Best app for music.
__label__song_selection __label__connectivity __label__user_experience __label__podcast I don't know if it's just me, but whenever I have another app open Spotify randomly stops, making me have to go to the app to get my music back, and whatever song it was on, even if it almost done, restarts. Other then that, spotify is great for listening to music, or podcasts!
__label__user_experience Once again Spotify isn't working properly. Sort it!
__label__bug __label__support The app has been VERY glitchy the last 2 days. A developer needs to look at it.
__label__user_experience __label__bug __label__account Blank screen with Spotify logo is appearing and nothing is happening. Uninstalled and reinstalled it but it's the same nothing changed.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience I love it. I can listen to my music whenever I want to without interruptions. Thank you for all you do.
__label__user_experience Solid experience while using this app, much appreciated!
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection I'm going out but the most important thing is I was thinking about you all day tomorrow, will have a great time and effort into selecting songs. The process could be improved, though. I have been having some problems but the most important thing is that I can listen to the ones I was thinking about all day tomorrow, which will make the time pass wonderfully. But the effort into the process could be improved somewhat.
__label__bug __label__advert Unstable and full of issues. Freezes after an advert. A clean install, cache, and data clean cannot make it run. If you can't create an app that works, don't offer it.
__label__user_experience Nice relaxing app that keeps improving over time
__label__user_experience Excellent App. Very enjoyable.
__label__advert __label__comparison Too many ads as compared to other music platforms..but yet again less than youtube 🙃🙃
__label__account __label__support I'm having problem with purchasing. It can't be done via voucher. Fix it.
__label__user_experience __label__support 3 weeks ago my Spotify all of a sudden stop playing. I emailed Spotify team about it. After 3 weeks my Spotify is back and working again
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience I can't play the songs I select - no matter whether I uninstall or log out and log in again. Extremely frustrating.
__label__user_experience __label__subscription_or_cost __label__song_selection The user interface is super intuitive, the premium subscription benefits are cool, it's just great overall. The only thing keeping me from giving 5 stars is how little it pays the artists.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection First time user - thumbs up! Not sure what it can do yet.
__label__user_experience __label__bug I can't even open the app anymore. I've been trying to open it for the past two weeks. I tried to re-download it multiple times, but it still won't open for some reason.
__label__song_selection __label__audio_quality I am enjoying good music serious nice songs
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__advert __label__song_selection Good but without premium there is a lot of ads and I can't listen to the song I want
__label__user_experience Great app for old-fashioned listeners.
__label__song_selection Highly refreshing song selection... top notch song selection to the max
__label__song_selection This is the best app for listen music I was ever seen
__label__podcast __label__song_selection __label__bug __label__user_experience Recent update broken With this last update I have been unable to access any music. It won't play anything. It doesn't allow me to even play downloaded, or even show my music or podcasts. Fabulous, back to not sleeping well. Upset because it's been fine for years. And now that I rely on the stories and mediations to sleep, now it decides to not work at all.
__label__podcast I enjoy all the podcasts
__label__song_selection __label__playlist __label__user_experience Plays songs that aren't even on the the liked song playlist and just litters it with songs from genre you don't even like listening. Good luck listening to something like metal because you'll get forced to listening to love songs for lonely people.
__label__comparison Spotify you are the best
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__song_selection I love the app, even without premium you still get great music options and an awesome experience! 10/10 recommend!!
__label__playlist __label__song_selection I really enjoy Spotify. I make my own playlist. put my ear buds on and get lost in my music thanks Spotify yall rock 🎸
__label__account __label__user_experience __label__connectivity I logged out of my account now when i open it it stays on the loading screen my wifi isnt even the issue bcs spotify lite works good.
__label__podcast __label__bug __label__subscription_or_cost It won't play a podcast for longer than 10 minutes without stopping and I have to restart the app and it's premium.
__label__account __label__connectivity Its really bad now, every time try to pay it always reconnect over and over. Enough with Spotify.
__label__song_selection Great song choices.
__label__user_experience __label__playlist Won't play other songs after clicking the play button and I can't figure out where to turn off shuffle for my liked Playlist.
__label__user_experience __label__account __label__song_selection Well I do got to say had to change my mind at first I thought this site sucks what not and in the end if you do your due diligence you can get back your accounts they're pretty cool you just got a member save save your Everything download whatnot it's just got to be a better way to download it to your SD card and s*** like that when you have 100,000 songs other than that f****** Spotify Spotify hit him up download it and go you guys rock 100%
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__song_selection Even though you have to have premium to pick a song it's pretty good
__label__user_experience __label__playlist I really enjoy using this app, but I do have one suggestion. I'd love it if we were able to create playlist folders on mobile. It'd make it much easier to look through my library. Still though, wonderful to use! <3
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__support You can't cancel the subscription, it gives you the runaround and I had to cancel my debit card over it.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience I love the music added to this, except it keeps getting rid of some songs, some of them my favorites, but most of all, it makes me happy, especially the lofi.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection Wonderful music app. I love the new music Spotify finds for me. Thank you.
__label__playlist __label__user_experience I like Spotify but when I use the app it tells me I have no play lists and all the play lists have nothing on them but when I use Spotify on the website I have 2 play lists and there is play lists, why is that?
__label__user_experience __label__subscription_or_cost __label__advert __label__song_selection Been using spotify for 6 or 7 years and had all together a year or more of premium. Was a great app but now I'm literally getting ads every 2 songs. So I can't recommend it anymore.
__label__song_selection __label__bug __label__user_experience Overall, a great application for listening to music 10/10 for that. However the app has some bugs sooo uhhh yeah, I can't even open the app anymore without being stuck on the logo sooo you guys lose points there. 8/10 would recommend.
__label__comparison __label__user_experience __label__playlist __label__song_selection I love it on my Xbox but the mobile app is poorly formatted and impossible to use, and the limited skips an hour is bs, when you run out you can just change the song manually, and why can't you view the songs on a Playlist as a list of individuals like on xbox, the littoral console with a controller being your only way of control, that's right, the xbox version is better formatted than the mobile peice of junk.
__label__song_selection Best music streaming service ever!!
__label__song_selection I love it, the best song selection, thanks.
__label__user_experience Probably my most used app, I use it every day and have never not used it. Full ratings deserved.
__label__advert __label__song_selection Spotify is a good music app not that many ads and I would really recommend it to my friends.
__label__song_selection __label__comparison __label__account __label__subscription_or_cost __label__user_experience Great way to find and listen to all types of music and get introduced to new artists. But the fact that I can't listen to the song I want to without buying the premium service is extremely annoying. If you want to ask that serves as customizable radio for yourself this is the one for you.
__label__advert The best app to listen to advertisements
__label__user_experience __label__support A Great experience when you can see the progression of your own music on here flourish you provide a lot for us musicians keep the good work up and fighting for the artists rights and best interest
__label__podcast __label__comparison I like the podcasts and I used to listen to audio books on youtube but I think I'll keep listening to Spotify.
__label__advert __label__audio_quality Why are literally all of your ads 3x louder than the songs stop
__label__user_experience __label__bug Why this app getting worse! Songs playing and I can't see the player. I can't stop, skip, or do anything. Please fix it.
__label__song_selection I get to listen to all my favorite bands it's amazing I love it and awesome 😎 too I'm a fan of bands so yeah!
__label__advert __label__song_selection This app is a must but the only thing I don't like it because there's too much of add. After playing one or two songs, there you can hear the sound of the add.
__label__comparison __label__song_selection __label__playlist __label__user_experience It works good on pc but on the phone it's garbage.... When i click to play a song it automatically shuffles to another song that i did not click on... No way you can take off the shuffle at all so i had to uninstall it...
__label__song_selection Good selection, not so good app.
__label__audio_quality __label__user_experience Always great quality. Always works great.
__label__song_selection __label__advert Spotify is one of the best music apps on this planet! There are absolutely NO ads! Nothing gets in the way of Spotify's music!
__label__user_experience __label__advert __label__song_selection Haven't used this app for a very long time and I don't followed any changes, but before I was able to listen one song, I had to watch 8 (!) ads. Like 3 X 30 seconds and 5 X 15 seconds ad. The song was shorter than those ads.
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__song_selection Best music app ever, I used to spend 100 bucks a month on CDs but now 9.99 is all and the best part is that this app finds great new music I would never have found! I LOVE YOU SPOTIFY "PLATONIC OF COURSE"!
__label__song_selection __label__subscription_or_cost Great music app, premium is a must.
__label__song_selection The heart button doesn't work, so I can't add songs to my liked songs
__label__podcast __label__song_selection Go to choice for podcasts and music, good app.
__label__bug __label__song_selection __label__subscription_or_cost __label__user_experience Recent update needs urgent bug fix!! Control bar missing, music glitches when I turn off phone screen or navigate apps, and sometimes my phone will just start playing randomly now. I don't know what you guys did, but a quick fix would be to just restore an update to last patch. Love Spotify but can't use (or want to pay for) an app like this....
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience When I clicked on the songs I wanted to hear it sometimes puts other songs but overall it has all my favorite songs so yeah idk lol I still recommend it to a lot of people
__label__song_selection __label__playlist __label__user_experience It keeps on turning my music off as well as changing to music that's not even in my playlists. Me giving it one star might be a bit harsh but, I would like to listen to the music I choose otherwise what's the point of a playlist.
__label__connectivity __label__playlist __label__song_selection __label__bug The app isn't working on my phone anymore (Samsung A20). It was working just fine before the more recent update, but now all the playlists are empty and I can't play a single song (and no, I don't have offline mode turned on).
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__advert __label__user_experience __label__song_selection Okay, I have a subscription so I don't have any adverts but my user experience on my phone wasn't working well. It wasn't showing something was playing and would stop in the middle of a song.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__audio_quality It was good until they started altering my song preferences using advanced audio techniques. Now, all of the song lyrics are different than the original artist's and it's quite unsettling.
__label__account I couldn't open my Spotify account anymore!
__label__account __label__support __label__subscription_or_cost You're better off paying for youtube music. There is no way to cancel your account/subscription if you forgot any credentials like a password or user name. Have sent them several emails to attempt to cancel since you can't call them but there is no way to cancel because they say they can't find my account but they are charging me for it.
__label__comparison I switched to Spotify after Google discontinued play music and haven't regretted it.
__label__song_selection __label__account __label__subscription_or_cost __label__bug Seems like the random stopping of songs has been fixed.thank you! And also people If you can accept what's included on the free account just upgrade And stop complaining!!
__label__user_experience __label__bug I love this app. However, recently it's been glitchy. I can't control the songs. The control features are gone. The app stops. Please fix soon.
__label__song_selection __label__subscription_or_cost __label__advert Pretty awesome... I get to listen to music and stuff. You have to have a subscription if you don't want to listen to ads every other song.
__label__user_experience So convenient and easy to use
__label__song_selection Very nice But innum songs add panuga
__label__connectivity __label__user_experience Continuing to say no internet connection.. with full bars. All other apps working.
__label__song_selection I would have given it a 5out of 5 but not because it doesn't let me replay a song.
__label__user_experience __label__bug __label__support Spotify app has been abruptly freezing and becoming unstable on my One plus 9R device. Requesting the team to look into the same. I suspect it's due to the recent OS update by One Plus.
__label__bug __label__subscription_or_cost Great app, although it can be glitchy at times. Paying for premiums so worth it.
__label__user_experience __label__podcast __label__account __label__subscription_or_cost What's happened? I've been using Spotify for years with no problems. But now podcasts keep randomly pausing, and the control bar has disappeared so I can no longer easily play and pause, or use the sleep function. This app isn't cheap and with this reduced functionality I feel I'm getting a poor deal.
__label__user_experience __label__advert __label__song_selection __label__playlist __label__podcast __label__connectivity The worst app I've ever used, ads all the time and a lot of them, six skips AN HOUR plus not being able to play any song you like you have to listen to a whole Playlist in a random order with a few songs you were actually looking for, I also constantly run into problems that span across four phones and a laptop so it isn't my device, another limitation is listening on only one device at a time and it takes a little to switch, the only thing I use it for is listening to podcasts which isn't bad.
__label__podcast __label__bug __label__user_experience I always used to like this app and it was my favourite app to listen music or podcasts to, but lately I can't really download anything even though I have plenty of storage left and the app keeps on stopping. I deleted the app multiple times and restarted my phone but nothing works and after the last update everything just got worse.
__label__user_experience __label__connectivity Excellent service with all chromecast devices
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__song_selection It's ok, but $10/month is too much to pay, especially knowing how little the artists actually get out of that money.
__label__song_selection __label__playlist __label__user_experience I will only rate 5 if you include option "Set Music As" Ringtone, Alarm Tone and Message Alert tone. Edit: I'm lowering my rating more because it's annoying that it doesn't have option to remove a certain song directly from my playlist. I still need to get out and find the song to remove it instead of it being available when you click the 3 dots.
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__song_selection __label__audio_quality __label__user_experience Great app, just wish there were cheaper plans bc when you're a kid and don't make bank and you want to listen to music...you don't really have the funds to give up 10 dollars a month...I know it doesn't sound like a lot but if you think about it, you're not "getting" anything, you are enjoying music, and I guess you can just use the default like I do but it is just limiting. The app itself is great with a huge song selection and good audio quality, not glitchy and great user experience!
__label__song_selection __label__advert Worst song app because it's have an ad in between of songs so worst
__label__comparison __label__subscription_or_cost __label__song_selection __label__podcast So far so good .... Came over from another streaming service and its only the first billing month , I have had no problems and the song selection is much better, lots more podcasts to choose from and .... I don't even miss Neil Young ✌
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__comparison __label__account This is a bad app. Resso is much better than Spotify. A song is repeated over and over again. I wanted to give it zero star, but There is no system for that. I'm uninstalling it.
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__advert __label__playlist __label__account All previous comments been covered. Started off brilliant under premium plan. Now ads coming fast as. I didn't pay to listen to ads & lose playlists etc. I'm canceling subscription.
__label__user_experience The app won't even launch on my phone Just keeps showing the Spotify logo I'm disappointed
__label__advert Very good app but so many ads
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__support __label__subscription_or_cost __label__bug Spotify is the perfect name....spotty at best. I cant believe how many times the app plays music and sometimes it just doesnt want to. Mix that with zero phone support and fix the problem is a joke. I pay for this service for way to long now it just doesnt work at all. Ive looked at all forums and nothing has fixed the problem.
__label__song_selection __label__bug __label__account __label__subscription_or_cost I've recently been struggling with certain issues related to my app. On occasion, a song will play, but the profile for that song will show a different one, causing lag. Normally I resolve this issue by restarting my smartphone or updating my Spotify app. However, what annoys me the most is the app not loading anymore. It just sticks to the black loading screen with the green logo but never proceeds past this. It is quite disappointing at the moment, particularly considering that I pay for the premium service. I use a Samsung Galaxy Note 10.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection Best app to listen to music, unfortunately some of the rarest song & artist that I was looking forward to listen sometimes not available 😢
__label__user_experience __label__bug __label__song_selection Still buggy but functional. I still see bugs that are really confusing and frustrating. Beyond that, it's alright. Shuffle doesn't work properly. Will improve rating with further bug fixes and shuffle improvement
__label__song_selection __label__bug I'm having the same issues as some of the last reviews, Spotify keeps pausing 3-4 times a song. It's very frustrating and I've starting using another service. Hopefully they can get this problem resolved asap.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience It's bad it doesn't let you pick your own song. It's so confusing
__label__support __label__bug __label__account __label__advert I spoke with support for hours about a bug I was experiencing and the final conclusion was that the issue was with my account. If you have issues that are specific to an account you should clearly advertise it as such if you aren't going to address it.
__label__user_experience One of the best music app
__label__playlist __label__connectivity My go to music app, first started using it years ago because no connection was needed to hear my playlists and I have never strayed.
__label__song_selection I find every song every time
__label__account __label__playlist Damn My profile picture was in my Spotify and click man I love the playlist thank you so much
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience Excellent at guessing what kind of music I'd like to hear next. Always a great listening experience.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__connectivity Every song you've heard and more is on here, however, 1 BIG ISSUE, when I enter the app it will say "nothing playing" when there is very much something playing and it will play in the background but I can't control it at all from my notification bar
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience Awesome app that stays up to date with the latest rap and hip hop. My favorite app for music by far.....
__label__song_selection It is because you don't have the right lyrics for a song.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience Won't show current song playing leaving one to scour the web based on lyrics! So much fun
__label__advert __label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__comparison __label__audio_quality So bad. Ads that will lag your device [S10] and will pop up and start playing random song's at random times. Try YT music and audible The programs MUST be trolling.
__label__song_selection __label__subscription_or_cost I don't want to give money just to listen to a specific song
__label__bug __label__connectivity Constant crash and video restarts. Instantly connects and plays last video to any Bluetooth device you are connected to
__label__song_selection __label__subscription_or_cost I wish that you didn't have to buy a membership to listen to most the songs
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection Doesn't save songs for offline listening to SD card properly.
__label__subscription_or_cost very good just wish their were less without having to pay
__label__audio_quality __label__connectivity __label__song_selection __label__playlist It's been overall great improvement within a couple of years and audio quality is great. The app synchronizes between devices perfectly and I love this feature to switch between devices while playing a song. The only thing I found weak is song selections, though I am using this app for a couple of years but still it doesn't recommend or make an auto playlist which I like and groove. Please start using better algorithms so it can suggest and make better playlists for different users.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience How do I play a song instead of a damn playlist..... please.. tell me.... I can't figure out after about an hour.
__label__song_selection Yes it's good cause i like jazz wt all my heart
__label__user_experience __label__subscription_or_cost It won't even load and that's very upsetting considering I was charged for it.
__label__user_experience __label__support I might as well just totally discontinue usage of this service. I hope they didn't layoff good staff for high school interns.
__label__audio_quality __label__podcast __label__bug __label__user_experience As of 7/7, this issue has been resolved. I have changed my review to reflect this change. It is normally great, but recently the app has been stopping audio randomly, not letting me pause or fast forward, the popup doesn't appear, so I can't scroll in the song. I have to close the app to stop the music. While listening to podcasts, the podcast will stop and I will have to start over. Due to bugs in the current update, I'm not able to fast forward to where I was.
__label__song_selection __label__playlist __label__user_experience Great choice of music, easy to create playlist and music always at my fingertips 💃
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__playlist I am thoroughly enjoying Spotify and the user experience that I have with this song selection service to create Playlist of my favorite types of music.
__label__song_selection Spotify music player good app
__label__song_selection __label__audio_quality __label__user_experience __label__playlist __label__subscription_or_cost I've been a long time user of spotify and love the amount and quality of music I can use, but recently it's like I'm paying for nothing. Everytime I try to load my downloaded songs I have to close the app a couple times before it will load. I pay to have the ability to listen offline and am not getting that.
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__connectivity __label__user_experience __label__bug I pay for premium and lately its been very aggressive about pausing my song whether I'm on wifi or data. Its been happening to a lot of people I've talked to as well. Please fix it.
__label__song_selection Spotify plays all of my favorite songs 🎵
__label__account __label__song_selection __label__user_experience A must app. But payment issues in Nepal and can we select songs with certain lyrics please. Considering these minor things, Spotify is a great app to listen to music.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience I get everything I need right on Spotify.
__label__song_selection __label__advert You can find just about any song I don't get ads.
__label__advert I would give this app five stars if it didn't have so many ads.
__label__playlist __label__connectivity __label__user_experience __label__song_selection New update and a new problem comes up!! Now i can't search for my playlists! Can't queue properly. Uninstalled and reinstalled and it's crashed three times on chromecast in 20 minutes! You guys really are total idiots. And now artists tracks are missing. Utterly useless.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience Really enjoy the music. No technical problems.
__label__song_selection __label__advert __label__user_experience I enjoy listening to my songs on Spotify but it's kind of dumb to listen to your tunes and get an advert interruption during a song. Otherwise, I would've rated it 5 but I give you a 3, it could be better.
__label__user_experience __label__playlist Improve feature as like if u right swipe the playlist, they gets queued as well, just like songs.
__label__comparison __label__song_selection __label__playlist __label__subscription_or_cost Used for a year, and it's better than Pandora, however.. Missing the most basic feature, play history. This is why I refuse to pay. I use Pandora and Spotify to discover new music, and when I can't look up who just played, whats the point really? Edit: Still broken.
__label__song_selection Love this versatile option for exploring and enjoying my music choices
__label__song_selection So many great songs to choose from!!
__label__song_selection You guys should add JPop to the main genres on the menu, just as you've added Kpop.
__label__user_experience __label__subscription_or_cost Using this every day, all the time. Subscription is worth it.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__audio_quality This app is so hard to navigate on phone if I click a a song a have liked it goes to didn't song I never heard or it might play a demo of the song that is dumb it should play the song
__label__user_experience Been a great experience, highly recommend.
__label__song_selection Great app for finding your favorite music
__label__user_experience __label__support App doesn't even open! Uninstalled it and re downloaded it and nothing still not working !
__label__comparison __label__account I used to have beats that then turned into Apple Music, (which I did not like at all). I found out about Spotify and do not regret getting it.
__label__podcast __label__bug __label__user_experience On my galaxy s22 this app is unreliable at best. Podcasts drop off or the app crashes and I can't stop the track and Spotify doesn't remember where I was inside of the podcast. It's not usable.
__label__song_selection Excellent choices in music based on my tastes
__label__support __label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__playlist generally good (Spotify is a great service). removing a star because their team seems generally unwilling to listen to feedback from the user community. just go look at their help forums for tons of examples where an issue is reported, backed up by hundreds of users, but no indication they will work on it. please fix the shuffle algorithm! I have a 40 hour playlist but end up hearing the same songs every day.
__label__podcast __label__user_experience __label__song_selection Endless issues, stops and/or starts without any reason, plays episodes I didn't request. Frequently stops and won't play at all. It's the worst of all the podcast players I use - I only use it because I can't get Rogan anywhere else. If it wasn't for Joe Rogan and the Dark Horse podcast, I'd dump it in a heartbeat and never miss it.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection I love the Spotify app. Especially the lyrics feature...I can sing along!
__label__user_experience Love it!!! Great user experience also.
__label__song_selection __label__podcast __label__subscription_or_cost Definitely a good app for music or podcasts. The premium subscription thing is probably a bit overpriced though.
__label__account __label__subscription_or_cost __label__user_experience __label__song_selection Nothing. After I registered and pay premium I can't play or add, open profile of my account. How it this even possible? Plus playlist from Spotify also marked as empty.
__label__song_selection __label__connectivity I love that I can listen to my downloaded music without using my data.
__label__song_selection I enjoy spotify. every song I want it right here.
__label__song_selection Love it especially every favorite song I play, especially since I'm a big music enthusiast.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__user_experience UI needs work (by that I mean just a simple feature to be added as to swipe down on the mini player and that ends the song )so far so good tho
__label__connectivity __label__user_experience __label__user_experience __label__song_selection Very spotty connectivity, laggy user experiences on mobile and desktop interfaces that crash and hang with no explanation. Song selection shrinking due to political and copyright issues.
__label__podcast __label__user_experience This is the worst podcast player. Everything is harder than it should be.
__label__account __label__subscription_or_cost __label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__user_experience I loved when I downloaded it but after like one week it's forcing to buy the premium version. I can't even play a single song without buying it. It's really annoying! I loved this app & keep wanted to use it but...
__label__user_experience I don't understand why Spotify needs my mic in order to work. Otherwise I have no trouble with the app.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection It was an ok app, didn't have it that long, was used to Pandora music playing. Guess I will try it again someday.
__label__podcast __label__song_selection Best streaming music and podcast app. Especially if you like discovering new music, this app is for you.
__label__user_experience Didn't think I would enjoy Spotify, I couldn't have been more wrong. Dr
__label__connectivity __label__subscription_or_cost I have good internet connection, but system keep saying that I'm not connected. What's wrong with this? I have the same problem every time I need to buy a premium. Please fix.
__label__song_selection It's the best app to listen to your favorites songs
__label__user_experience __label__audio_quality Everything works and sounds great.
__label__song_selection Good stuff on Spotify.
__label__connectivity It takes so long just to download
__label__song_selection __label__playlist __label__user_experience Ok so here's the deal Spotify has this new update where they add there recommended songs on there...this is a problem because you come to Spotify to listen to your Playlist and the music you like now all you here on YOUR Playlist is songs you don't know and can't sing along to...the only way to get rid of it is by adding at least 15 songs to your Playlist! So me being like ok I did so...for awhile everything was good but then Spotify kept playing songs that I didn't add! USELESS!!!
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection This app is good but please make an update where I can delete recently played songs, please I BEG YOU
__label__user_experience __label__bug __label__connectivity Long time user. Lately it's been full of glitches. Can't control the app, it always says Spotify is trying to play, it randomly pauses whatever you're listening to every few minutes. It's almost unusable right now. Its a shame because it's been my go to for so long 😕
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__support I love this app but when I try to listen to my favorite song it selects something else, that's why I'm not completely satisfied, please rectify this issue.
__label__playlist __label__song_selection Love Spotify I recommend it to all my friends absolutely love the blend playlist.
__label__audio_quality __label__user_experience I just wish for better sound quality and a light mode option
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__advert __label__comparison __label__podcast __label__user_experience I pay for Spotify premium now because I don't like ads but Amazon music was absolutely atrocious when it came to podcasts. I have had zero issues with Spotify at anytime for anything!
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection Easy to use enjoyable and entertaining
__label__user_experience It works only when you open it, it's getting hard to use.
__label__audio_quality __label__song_selection __label__support I don't know if it is just my headphones, my device, or the app but it only makes the background sound and the shouting audible, but the melody in the songs doesn't play at all. If this problem is fixed I will rate 5 stars.
__label__advert __label__comparison 30 mins 1-2 ads (pc), 10 mins 3 ads (android/ios)
__label__bug Every time I want to play a song, it plays the wrong song that I don't like. Please fix this.
__label__user_experience My favourite app. The perfect one. Love you Spotify 💜
__label__song_selection A huge collection of music
__label__song_selection __label__podcast __label__subscription_or_cost __label__support __label__bug Amazing for song selection. Glitchy and extremely unreliable for podcasts. Please fix it asap, subscription doesn't feel worth it anymore. Edit: One year later and the issue remains. 2 star becomes 1 star.
__label__user_experience __label__subscription_or_cost __label__audio_quality __label__support __label__bug I've used spotify for years and have paid for premium for a few years now. Recently the app has started skipping and cutting the music like a broken record. The problem stops when my phone screen is either unlocked or at least on. I've tried all of the recommended fixes online. None of them have worked. If the problem persists I will be canceling my premium subscription.
__label__podcast __label__user_experience __label__song_selection Does whatever it wants, it's easily the worst of the apps similar to it. It turns podcasts on or off at will and changes the podcast mid episode and loses its place which can be annoying to go back and track down where you left off. All this especially since 99% of the time I'm using the app while driving. Not a fan but I got a prompt to review the app so here it is.
__label__user_experience Very interesting! great format, real lovely.
__label__user_experience __label__account This is probably just a personal experience, but I've reinstalled the app three times, restarted my phone, and cleared the cache twice but the app won't work. It will open and just show me the logo. I'm not even given the option to sign in.
__label__song_selection Every time I try to listen to a specific song, it plays something different.
__label__song_selection Very good selection of music
__label__song_selection Wonderful song selection
__label__song_selection Spotify has introduced me to so much great music based on what I already listen to. Every music lover should have this app!
__label__account __label__user_experience __label__subscription_or_cost __label__user_experience After few minutes of setting up the account, and after I started using it, I was surprised by the amount of restrictions that come with it, to a level that makes it unusable. It feels like being boxed in. I am not pleased with the heavy push to upgrade to premium which is not fully justified. Nonetheless, if you want to enhance user experience, at least highlight its cool features and prove its usefulness for at least the first few days, then I might reconsider if maybe I would like to opt for the premium.
__label__user_experience Just awesome and easy
__label__user_experience __label__bug __label__account __label__connectivity The fact that the sometimes you can't end group session and needing to reinstall it every time is cancer. Because of that sometimes the reinstalled app can't open. You can't even do a damn group session on the desktop like bro it's 2022 how badly advanced do you want it to be.
__label__user_experience __label__subscription_or_cost i love it!!! very useful and worth it u should try
__label__podcast __label__user_experience Love the app, but somehow now it doesn't show me audio controls for podcasts. Meaning I can't pause, skip, go back, or whatever. :/
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__playlist __label__bug I got Spotify premium but why can't I click the shuffle button multiple times, now it just starts nd pauses the song. Plz fix its annoying
__label__user_experience __label__connectivity __label__advert Best music app but it has flaws, I'm on android and if I plug in my headphones, Spotify automatically starts playing without me going into the app. Another flaw is that it's going to play ads every 30 minutes but it's more like every 10 minutes. Great app overall though.
__label__podcast __label__user_experience Spotify podcasts are disappointing. The only reason I use it is to occasionally listen to Rogan but unfortunately, it barely functions. Spotify should reconsider their podcast offerings because they are failing at providing a reliable podcast player.
__label__playlist __label__account __label__user_experience My playlists are not on Spotify mobile so I can't do anything on it. Linked account on laptop, etc work fine. Only mobile. 1 star.
__label__advert __label__song_selection Too many advertisements. Had to listen to 10 advertisements in a row before finally listening to some music.
__label__user_experience __label__bug The Play bar disappears, preventing skipping or pausing the playing episode. The only solution is to forcibly close the app.
__label__podcast Love using this podcast
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__playlist You guys are making this app worst day by day. You need to understand what the users demand. Just don't think about your so called business. For example, today I was playing my liked song and it jumped into another playlist. And now I can't even change the song or playlist. What the heck is this?
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__song_selection Spotify premium is great app to play all your fav music!
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience Why you added that hiding feature? Because it sucks when I want to unhide any song!
__label__user_experience Fantastic app bc it so cool an easy to use
__label__song_selection Well worth it for an infinity of songs and especially because there aren't any lame whining Canadian Neil Young songs...🤣
__label__user_experience Brilliant app
__label__bug __label__user_experience Love this app, however there is a bug where the player is not showing and its becoming really annoying.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience My music keeps stopping for no reason. The web player for computers is way better than the app.
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__user_experience You have to buy premium for the app to work correctly
__label__podcast __label__connectivity Downloaded episodes don't play without internet. What's the point
__label__song_selection Best music player in the world love you spotify 💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗
__label__audio_quality __label__song_selection wowwwwwww one of the best audio play music platform i love it. awesome.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__subscription_or_cost __label__comparison __label__support Moved to Deezer after constant skipping of songs or restarting them, plus random shut down. Just because you are the largest streaming company does not mean you can provide a substandard experience to your paying customers. I would advise not starting a payment subscription right now as these issues have been going on for months. My subscription is now cancelled and I've moved to Deezer which provides a far superior user experience.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience I can't give this 5 stars because they took one of my absolute favorites (planet net, by the subdigitals) off here completely😔. But i'll give 4 for everything else.
__label__advert __label__song_selection __label__user_experience Great app for playing music, although when I search up a song I want to play, after all the adverts have played, I have to skip through multiple different songs and sometimes I can't get to the song I want due to user experience design, so most of the time I go on yt and play it because I can't be bothered waiting for songs I don't know to finish playing!
__label__song_selection __label__subscription_or_cost __label__user_experience I would have rated it 5 but the lyrics in songs are in that (ex. Korean, Telugu) language only, I mean English too. I took a subscription for a week and it just won't let me see the download option.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__audio_quality Amazing app and whatever song you search... You're gonna find it.... It's so flexible to use and really good audio quality 🥰
__label__user_experience __label__connectivity __label__playlist __label__subscription_or_cost __label__comparison These new updates lack practicality. Is there going to be a fix for the offline mode? When I don't have data, I want to access my downloaded playlist but all I get is a blank screen. I shouldn't need more data to play something that's already downloaded. I'm thinking about cancelling my subscription due to these issues. I might give YouTube Music a go as an alternative.
__label__bug __label__playlist __label__user_experience Has been bugging out recently. Won't show what I'm playing, will randomly stop, isn't keeping track of playlists
__label__advert __label__song_selection __label__user_experience It's pretty cool I like it but too much ads and lyrics in songs are wrong but still I like it.
__label__podcast __label__connectivity When I try to watch a podcast using Spotify on my t.v it won't show me the image
__label__podcast __label__song_selection __label__user_experience Echoing the feedback from other premium users - the app was working perfectly fine until a few months ago. Now podcasts and music pause without obvious reasons, and some of the buttons disappear randomly. It's really frustrating.
__label__bug __label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__subscription_or_cost Covid spam, crashing, hard to navigate. Takes forever to load list of episodes. No fast forward. Buy premium to skip song lol.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience This is best app because all songs are available on it and also my favourite Kaira l love *Spotify* Thank you *Spotify*for this you are amazing
__label__song_selection The hell is wrong with Spotify. It always play the wrong music
__label__user_experience __label__support Why can't I use the app for a few days now? I tried uninstalling and reinstalling. Even rebooting my phone and yet nothing happens. I need to stream.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection The user experience needs to be a little more intuitive when it comes to reporting songs with swear words in as some are missed. Also, they do not include certain swear words into the explicit song selection so I will often hear offensive language in songs and no explicit label next to them.
__label__song_selection Best music app so far
__label__account __label__subscription_or_cost __label__support Hi, I changed my account to 2 accounts, the monthly fee went up but the changes didn't happen, when you don't do your job properly, how do you expect to receive the fee?
__label__song_selection This is an AMAZING app and I feel that it has all of the songs I ever want to play and I am glad I downloaded it.
__label__song_selection Brilliant music experience.
__label__bug __label__user_experience __label__connectivity __label__song_selection I really don't understand how one of the biggest music apps on the planet can be this buggy. Frequently missing the "now playing" tab at the bottom of the app, which means all controls (skip, pause, etc) are missing. Randomly says "no internet connection" while clearly connected to the internet and streaming. If you search for a song and play it, then let it autoplay similar songs afterwards, you can't go back and listen to the original song without backing out and selecting the song again.
__label__bug It's not opening. The app isn't opening
__label__song_selection Best platform for streaming music tbh
__label__playlist __label__subscription_or_cost __label__song_selection __label__user_experience Was good at one point. A very long time ago. Now just fluffs its own playlists with fake artists. Spotify has discovered its more profitable to pay themselves than it is to pay actual people, and has stuffed its playlists with fluff to smother out actual artists. Couple this with the horrible death spiral that is Daily Mixes (read: same 25 songs you heard yesterday, plus all the songs you tapped "block" on- in case you changed your mind) and also F "car thing". I have a stereo but yall ruined it.
__label__bug __label__song_selection __label__playlist There is some bug that does not allow the songs to be played in the order it shows in the playlist. Please fix this
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__song_selection I have premium but it still wont let me download songs for some reason
__label__user_experience __label__playlist __label__song_selection Absolutely love it! My husband and I both have playlists, that people follow. .trippylist is one of them.. If you like Phish, Dave Matthews, Widespread Panic, follow trippylist. And there are other bands on it.
__label__song_selection Nice app it's handy and most music is on it, you guys should add music soul mate.
__label__playlist __label__user_experience Good but please add an option to rearrange songs in our playlist again. Don't wanna open my PC and Google Chrome again and again just to do it.
__label__user_experience __label__support __label__subscription_or_cost __label__bug App will not load just flashing Spotify symbol and no customer support to fix it. I've had it since Google music stopped 2 years ago. I've loved Spotify since but for the past week the app won't load. I've uninstalled and installed 90 times but still won't load. Spotify needs customer service and support. You don't value our money or membership if you can't provide that much.
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__user_experience A little pricey, but am enjoying it....
__label__user_experience Works fine most of the time
__label__song_selection Nice app for music
__label__song_selection It's the best song selection.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__playlist it is a great app but it has a skip limit time now and it does not have the shuffle button anymore it does it automatically and if I click on a song it takes me to a different song that is not the one I chose, I will like to listen to my playlist in pieces 😤
__label__comparison Number 1 app in all music apps.
__label__playlist __label__subscription_or_cost It's a good app, but I don't like how you have to get premium to unshuffle your playlists.
__label__bug __label__subscription_or_cost __label__support __label__comparison __label__user_experience Love the app when it's working. I'm paying 10 bucks a month for something to crash every 15 min and I've been waiting for over a month for it to be fixed and it's not the app timer cause I checked. If it's not fixed soon I'll find and pay for another service cause dealing with this for 10 hours a day while I'm at work is ridiculous.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__connectivity __label__comparison Worst designed app I've ever used. Takes ages to load downloaded content, or to download content at all. Every page seems to take way too long to load. Get any other player.
__label__song_selection Great and easy to find your music.
__label__podcast __label__user_experience __label__bug Best music app no issues or any bugs
__label__user_experience __label__connectivity Great when it works, but crashes 30% of the time I try to use it, need to restart my phone just to get it to work again.
__label__song_selection __label__advert I love it so much, it feels very relieving when you listen to music. But the only problem is the ads.
__label__user_experience __label__subscription_or_cost Fantastic and free!
__label__user_experience I've seen worse user experience work on other apps, but not many.
__label__user_experience The app starts to crash very often, at this point it doesn't start anymore.
__label__song_selection Great music application 👌
__label__user_experience Best music app ever ❣❣❣
__label__user_experience __label__connectivity __label__song_selection __label__support __label__subscription_or_cost __label__comparison Premium user for 7 years but the app just does not work anymore! The play button is missing, and the app just stops working every 30 seconds when on mobile data!! What am I even paying for at this point? Even when the songs are downloaded and I am "offline"!! And you can't speak with a human about these issues, there is no telephone number!! Soooooo disappointed 😞. Im also looking into other music options now
__label__song_selection __label__podcast I love Spotify! Not only for song selection but I listen to podcasts before I go to bed each night. It helps me drift off to sleep 😴
__label__user_experience The app is great. The user experience so far has been top-notch. Keep it up Spotify!
__label__subscription_or_cost The app is good only if you purchase premium.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience It's won't shuffle the songs I have in my library or my liked songs. Since the update it won't shuffle the songs.
__label__playlist __label__podcast __label__song_selection __label__bug I love Spotify, but I've been having trouble using it since an Android update from a few days ago (I have a Samsung A50). I can't access any kind of media, whether it be albums, playlists, podcasts. All the songs have disappeared, but I still can see that the playlists (and so on) exists. Please fix this bug!!
__label__playlist __label__song_selection __label__user_experience It's really nice as you can make your own playlists but it doesn't show songs by its self. You need to search them and then add them all one by one.
__label__support __label__subscription_or_cost __label__user_experience __label__account __label__song_selection *UPDATE* Still no response re my emails. So disappointed. Time to cancel services I think. The status band from the bottom of the screen is gone. I can't pause, skip forward or back etc and it makes navigating the app frustratingly difficult. I have emailed a help request twice now with no response. I've uninstalled and reinstalled. I've logged out and back in. Still nothing. For an app I pay a premium price for I would think somebody would interested in resolving the issue.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection Easy to navigate App with all your fav tunes
__label__audio_quality __label__song_selection __label__comparison __label__subscription_or_cost HiFi promised by the end of 2021 yet still not available. All competitors have HiRes music and most have spatial audio. Spotify is so far behind the competition at this point. Can't wait to cancel.
__label__song_selection Never needed to look anywhere else for a specific song.
__label__user_experience __label__subscription_or_cost __label__account Hlo Sir I am Spotify user sir I request your premium plan on payment method in play store i requested you pls open the service in play store payment pls i humble request
__label__user_experience __label__playlist __label__podcast Spotify has become smoother since my last review, so I have to clear the app out of history a lot less. I'm not a big fan of the new plus button in the bottom right corner. I don't need to make a new playlist so often that a dedicated spot in the menu is necessary and I don't make podcasts at all. This button is functionally pointless for me and moved the other buttons that I used slightly to the left. Overall, still a great app. I'm just nitpicking the constant changes to the UI.
__label__user_experience __label__subscription_or_cost Constant problems with this app for 2 straight years. All that money and can't put out a good app that simply works...
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience Great music. Easy to navigate.
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__user_experience __label__bug __label__song_selection __label__support I've had Spotify paid subscription for years and love the app, but ever since the last update it randomly stops showing the song that is playing as well as pause stop next etc and the only way to see it again is to reboot my device. Could you please look and fix this?
__label__user_experience __label__account First of all i have it for like 1year now and it super works but rights now It didn't let me in i tried to uninstall it but it still didn't, pls fix this
__label__connectivity __label__account __label__support Since you've updated this app, it no longer connects to the dedicated Spotify app on my Pioneer Head unit, only through the phones Bluetooth. This has been proven by people uninstalling and reinstalling an older version though an apk install. Please fix. Zero interest from Spotify brings this down to one star due to lack of any support.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience There is no option to download single song. Download is available for full album Only. So add icon to download one by one song.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__advert __label__account I love it.... I will recommend this app for everyone to use♡ What I loved the most is that it shows lyrics in every single song and it has really few ads, you all guys know how irritating the ads are😢but you will not face that problem in Spotify👍👍👍I loved your application.
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__user_experience After using Spotify premium for 3 months it's nice but if you don't pay for it you will have a hell of a time doing anything on the app.
__label__advert __label__podcast __label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__subscription_or_cost __label__account __label__support Do not buy premium. You still get ads for podcasts. It is not the podcasts' ads, they are supplemental ads that go straight to Spotify. On top of that, they have overoptimized this just like every other app. Convenient to switch from car play to non-car play, only problem is the floating button is placed right over the play button for a song or album. These overlooked problems are everywhere. Buttons on top of buttons, settings not saving, network not updating. I cant justify $9.99/month anymore.
__label__song_selection __label__playlist __label__user_experience __label__account Spotify is a nice app and I like it very much but all of a sudden the songs in my playlist aren't visible and there are only names of the songs. I can't order the songs in the way that I want and I can't see what song is next. I deleted Spotify and installed it again but it didn't work, I also cleared cache but that still did nothing.
__label__user_experience __label__podcast I have to uninstall and reinstall this app every few days. Podcasts just randomly stop playing, even if I've downloaded them. Annoying.
__label__connectivity It always tells me I am offline. I know I'm not because all my other apps work fine.
__label__audio_quality __label__song_selection Good sound music any thing you want to listen to
__label__user_experience __label__subscription_or_cost Awful app and service. No longer paying for premium as spotify simply does not work!
__label__user_experience __label__connectivity Enjoying Spotify on phone & in car very much!
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__connectivity Terrible really. Slow to load menus, searches, library. Sometimes it won't even load my saved songs for minutes forcing me to restart the app. Even worse if it's in offline mode. Often just stops playing randomly and has to be reset to work again. Terrible app
__label__bug __label__podcast __label__song_selection __label__bug __label__connectivity __label__user_experience __label__support Whenever I randomly open the app (randomly) it just keeps stopping and I don't know why tap on a podcast another song starts playing.... It's not that my phone lags or something else but no my phone is brand new and about about my connection then I really have a very strong connection.... I uninstalled and reinstalled it but still same problem. It was making me sick.... I really hope that the developers see this issue and fix it..
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection I've always liked Spotify and how it adjusts to my music tastes and changes. The selection of available artists and songs is also awesome.
__label__song_selection I love this app. It helps a lot and you get anything you want from music, motivations I mean every kind of song.
__label__user_experience Since one and half hour i can't open the app. it's not opening. why?
__label__song_selection __label__playlist __label__user_experience __label__account Yaa...this is an app that is very nice.. It's feature are fantastic.😊 It has all types of songs like remix, any trending song, edited song, and any other song. In this app, you can create a lot of playlists without any lag. I like this app and you should download this app. After downloading this app, remember to "Rate" this application. Okay.... ; /
__label__user_experience Love Spotify, couldn't imagine my life without it...:)
__label__account __label__bug Had a login on my Spotify so I changed the password and logged out of all accounts and it let me log back in on my laptop but for some reason it's just stuck on the logo screen on my phone and a lot of other people have that problem if they log out. Not really sure what to do. I uninstalled it and restarted my phone and it didn't work either.
__label__comparison Best music streaming app hands down
__label__comparison This app is the best music app I have ever used.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience This song selection touches the very thought in mind . A true experience to listen.
__label__playlist __label__connectivity __label__song_selection __label__advert __label__bug Absolutely perfect except for the fact that (without Premium) I can only replay songs from my personal playlists on my tablet. However, I can replay my songs that are on my daily mixes ;) Recently, however, Spotify has been messing with my phone. I know it is Spotify because when I uninstall it, the stuff stops. Spotify, please stop pausing and skipping my music, stop pausing my YouTube videos and not letting me play them. Stop playing your music at random times when the app isn't even open.
__label__podcast __label__user_experience __label__subscription_or_cost Great content! Drops out sometimes or turns off for unknown reason.. but great free app!
__label__user_experience __label__subscription_or_cost __label__support Bad. For some strange reason my app is not working. I switched to premium and now the app just starts and shuts. Don't know if this issue is connected with my mobile or otherwise. Looking forward to hear from the technical team of Spotify thanks..
__label__song_selection Best music app on the market
__label__bug App crashes constantly
__label__user_experience __label__support It is great, and although there are still things to improve you can see they hear the user and improve what they need.
__label__song_selection __label__podcast I love music and I like the variety of music and songs arranged. I love to listen to all the podcasts.
__label__advert All good but ads come in every 15 min.
__label__song_selection __label__bug __label__user_experience Usually my go-to app for music but it won't stay open on my pixel 6. I've had to reinstall twice in 2 days.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__audio_quality Great so far easy to use .like the song selection that it suggests not everyone likes this feature. But love being able to listen to music
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__advert __label__user_experience __label__support I have purchased premium subscription to avoid "ads" but no use, waste of money, I am frustrated by ads... please don't waste your money...developers make improvement...otherwise no use.
__label__podcast __label__bug __label__account __label__subscription_or_cost __label__user_experience __label__song_selection I'm a premium user and can say this app is so buggy it's insane while listening to podcasts they constantly restart and i have to try and figure out where I left off because when it does restart it also marks the entire podcast as played so you have no clue where you left off on top of that since the new update i can't access what is actually playing on the app at all it doesn't even say I'm listening to anything and I'm unable to pause unless i close the app fix it I'm sick of paying for broken
__label__podcast All of my favorite podcasts from all aspects of my life in one place.
__label__podcast __label__playlist Navigating Podcasts is such a hassle. You scroll down a podcast, find a podcast and add it to your playlist. Then it goes right to the top. So you have to scroll down again.
__label__advert __label__user_experience The amount of Ads after listening to 15 minutes of music is getting frustrating. I'm a free user but I feel like I'm bombarded with ads.
__label__song_selection Very nice app for music lover
__label__song_selection great collection of music
__label__song_selection __label__podcast Love it! ❤ i can find all of my music, podcasts, meditations in one place.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection The whole package is great. I would recommend this app to everyone.
__label__playlist __label__song_selection __label__user_experience why did the shuffle option change when you listen one of your playlists ? it just sucks, the same songs play on repeat and you juste have to skip them MULTIPLE TIMES when you could just skip them once before, and just go on with your 45h of songs. Also the linked songs in the radio are the same that are already in my playlists, yeah I like them but what I wanted was discover new ones... and if you want to remove them from radio because you already know them it just delete them from your playlist.
__label__user_experience __label__comparison __label__bug __label__subscription_or_cost __label__playlist __label__song_selection Could've been a good app if it weren't so restricting. It's decent in comparison to other platforms, but the user experience on mobile is the worst. Too much lag, needs subscription for everything, and plays random songs you don't put in your playlist. You can't loop a song on mobile either.
__label__user_experience Great streaming app I use it everyday...🤙🤙🤙👍👍💯💯
__label__account __label__subscription_or_cost __label__user_experience I didn't like/ I don't like the automatic update! & now (without premium) how to one song on repeat?! This new update/new version 8.7.44.968 is Sucks!😡
__label__song_selection __label__subscription_or_cost __label__user_experience Terrible app. Can't even play the song you want. When I click a song it plays something entirely different. You can't do anything about it unless you have premium or you use a computer.
__label__user_experience __label__support Hi, I updated my app to the latest version but I still have problems with lyric sharing. Can't seem to find the button on it even after restarting my phone or clearing the data of the app itself. It would be great if you could help me on this one. Thank you!
__label__advert __label__subscription_or_cost __label__account __label__support ☹️☹️☹️ Spotify is an amazing app.. knowing that.. i went for the premium.. but even after the payment, it is still not showing premium and still I get ads .. if anybody could help.. please do☹️
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience Really good music easy to use
__label__song_selection __label__podcast __label__account __label__subscription_or_cost __label__user_experience 7/7/22 - The app had been working fine for a while, but is now suffering from the Samsung/Android issue. The playing now bar doesn't show up and the app stops playing randomly in the middle of songs and podcasts. 1/13/21 ‐ I've been using Spotify for about a year now (with a paid account) but recently the app has stopped playing anything. Will definitely cancel my service and uninstall if it continues.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience This is the Great Music listening App.. And guys seriously experience is great...
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection Have been using this platform for years, and I just now decided to rate it. It's everything and more! It's user-friendly and can be very personalized. 5/5 for sure!
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience Great app for listening to all your favorite songs plus finding new ones but there is always room for improvements.
__label__podcast __label__bug __label__user_experience __label__subscription_or_cost Used to work great until the last update. Now there is no option to pause or resume music or podcast. The only way to pause is to completely close the app. This really sucks Spotify, as a premium customer I should have an option to pause not close the entire app. Please fix this!!!!
__label__user_experience It's annoying when it crashes suddenly. Not that frequent but often enough to be annoying.
__label__song_selection __label__playlist __label__audio_quality __label__support The best music service in the universe!!! 97 custom playlists and counting. Downloaded music is amazing. You customer service is the best. Nobody can match Spotify.
__label__user_experience __label__podcast __label__song_selection This software is really terrible. I can't get rid of the "currently playing" item and I can't get the sort to play podcasts starting at season 1 episode 1. How in the world can such basic software be so bad.
__label__playlist __label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__bug I don't know what happened but I can't see the songs that I added in my play lists but in my liked songs I can see them. I'm hoping it could be fixed or it's just my problem? But this app is awesome 5 stars:))
__label__user_experience __label__bug can't open the app suddenly. I tried uninstalling it but it's the same after reinstalling again.. I'm stuck at the logo.
__label__song_selection Every song I look for is there....,. Still haven't found a song that isn't on there
__label__advert Too much adverts
__label__song_selection __label__playlist __label__user_experience Someone already mentioned it but I'd like to say it as well, the ease of adding songs to a playlist seems to be removed, it was very easy to add songs that way but now you have to play them before adding, not very important but just wish it wasn't removed•́ ‿ ,•̀
__label__bug __label__account __label__user_experience There's a glitch. I have to Uninstall and install the app. Sometimes when I press play. The player doesn't show.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience I love using it but damn I can't freely pick songs that I want to listen without shuffling So it makes me frustrated. 😐
__label__podcast __label__connectivity __label__user_experience After last update, I can't forward podcasts via Bluetooth or on mobile app.
__label__playlist __label__user_experience Here at Spotify you can create a world you want where you can express yourself without any hassle.
__label__user_experience Haven't been using long enough for 5 stars. Am happy so far. Still figuring stuff out.
__label__user_experience Best music app ever!!!
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience In the new update I am not able to add songs to the queue.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__connectivity I can no longer have my song selection play on my phone if I have it open on my computer, I have to close the app on my computer or else it will just disrupt my user experience on the phone.
__label__comparison Spotify does what I always wanted You tube to figure out.
__label__song_selection __label__podcast Spotify continues to play my music or podcast but won't show the control to pause play or skip my songs.
__label__user_experience Love Spotify.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__subscription_or_cost Best music app suggests this app for a superior user experience and stream or listen to selected songs. It's not a free platform. But the song selection algorithm is world class!
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__comparison Poor, music stops randomly, bar disappears, what's going on??? Think it's time to look at rivals.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__podcast __label__bug __label__comparison __label__subscription_or_cost Since last update the queue system is broken only lets you add one song to a queue and will frequently bug out and hide controls for currently playing podcasts and makes it impossible to pause it from the app. I dont know how you managed to ruin your music system more the YouTube music but this is embarrassing, if this isn't fixed by next billing date I'll be forced to move platforms so that I can actually listen to my music and podcasts
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__playlist All the music I need, easy to access and organize an extensive library.
__label__support __label__bug __label__account __label__subscription_or_cost For more than a week now I am unable to download Spotify app on my Samsung A51. I have been in touch with the support team and have carried out all the suggested troubleshooting measures like deleting data and cache, clearing up storage and memory, uninstalling and reinstalling numerous times. Spotify could not resolve the issue and then they wanted me to participate in a survey about their service...which felt like insult to injury...as it is a paid service and I feel duped by Spotify.
__label__podcast __label__advert __label__subscription_or_cost You podcast experience sucks please fix it and don't put adverts on an app that I pay for.
__label__user_experience __label__connectivity I can't even load the app anymore. I have a gig of free storage, so that's not it. I have had this problem for the past 3 weeks on or off wi-fi.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience Can not back to the previous song and when try to back the latest song is play, bad experience.
__label__podcast __label__song_selection __label__user_experience Dear Spotify Developer your awesome guys 💓💯... your song selection make my days beautiful. Every day 5 to 7 hours I enjoy music & podcast . I kindly request one thing please add user experience for people opinions or comments option add to podcast section.
__label__song_selection __label__bug Whenever I try to play or choose a song, the ones who show up are different I'd like to get that fixed.
__label__song_selection It's a very good app for song selection.
__label__user_experience __label__connectivity The app doesn't work. When I open the app I see just Spotify logo and it doesn't go
__label__account __label__user_experience __label__song_selection Overall, it's okay. I just hope that Spotify allows us to change our username :)) I do have/want to have Spotify mutuals & it's a hassle without having our own username ,, I hope in the next updates you'll have it already ^^.
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__advert Unless you plan on getting a subscription, don't bother. I had to listen to 2 minutes worth of ads after every 3 songs.
__label__podcast __label__bug __label__user_experience Trash podcast player. Crashed constantly mid podcast and have to close app and restart to try and finish listening. Garbage plain and simple.
__label__song_selection __label__subscription_or_cost __label__connectivity Good probably but like without paying we can't select songs and if we are traveling especially music lovers, it wouldn't come offline.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience Nice app! It would be great if it had a feature to help with Korean songs so I can sing along with it 😊
__label__bug __label__song_selection __label__podcast __label__user_experience __label__subscription_or_cost Been using it for years, it's always been buggy and has gotten much worse lately. Quits playing in the middle of songs. Quits playing in the middle of podcasts. Doesn't realize it's currently playing a song or podcast. The podcast library and list are so inferior, no reasonable sorting algorithms or ability to manually put your podcasts in order. Yes, I'm even a paid subscriber with a family plan 🤦‍♂️
__label__song_selection Good experience for music
__label__song_selection __label__advert __label__user_experience superb!! i like this app. you can set data usage and all song are there* but when you starting enjoying music *ad* comes so spotify have to give less ads on music.. i want to give 4.5 star but i cant lol'' :D
__label__audio_quality __label__bug Great quality sound. Many problems with app.
__label__user_experience Great no issues at all
__label__song_selection When I play my favorite song, then another song will play.
__label__user_experience Best music app by far
__label__comparison __label__user_experience Better than Pandora not as much data used.
__label__user_experience Really good experience 👌 no cap
__label__user_experience __label__bug __label__support Buggy to the point that I'm considering switching services. Restarting the app is now a ritual of being a user. Wasn't always like this, only the past few months. Whatever the case, dev team has shown little signs of a fix coming any time soon...
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__connectivity __label__user_experience __label__account Everything's great except when i m going to buy premium it keeps saying "can't connect to my internet" when my internet is doing just fine with other applications. It happens so many times at this point. And the updates don't change anything, it still says the same thing....
__label__song_selection __label__podcast Love the music and podcast suggestions. I never listen to the radio anymore, only Spotify!
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__connectivity The songs will not show in created playlists, only the artists. Also won't work with searching. Was fine on my tablet but just installed it on my new phone for convenience and was very disappointed.
__label__song_selection This app is just awesome. If you are someone who enjoys a wide selection of music, then just go for it.
__label__advert __label__subscription_or_cost __label__user_experience Great mobile music streaming app, but premium subscription is a must to avoid annoying ads. Hoping that user experience and song selection features will be expanded in future to be closer to the desktop app.
__label__song_selection My new favorite song selection!
__label__playlist __label__comparison __label__podcast __label__user_experience __label__advert It's a lot different from Pandora I can actually make my own playlist send them to friends I can listening to podcasts and everything. Overall good app but you really need to fix Those ads I got 11 in a row before I was allowed to listen to my music and then after listening to two songs I got 16 in a row so you really need to fix that ad problem.
__label__user_experience I can't open the app this is trash
__label__podcast __label__user_experience I don't see the control screen for podcasts anymore. It keeps playing in the background and there's absolutely no way to even pause or stop it other than force closing the app. This wasn't the case until today (July 07, 2022).
__label__user_experience __label__bug Stopped working. Uninstalled, installed new still won't load. Either stuck on logo or black screen.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection This app only let's me skip a few times and I can't add the song I want anymore so 1 star
__label__song_selection __label__playlist __label__user_experience __label__bug It is the best app that I have on my phone!! I can listen to my fav music and also make my own playlist so my friends can listen. Though, it has some problems. I dont like how I choose a song and it plays another song that is totally different from the song I chose. I also dont like it when I cant repeat the song I just listened. There is also a bug ive been experiencing lately. It always shows the spotify logo on the screen when I use my phone. Its a great app though:)
__label__playlist __label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__support While listening to my playlists the app will randomly divert to a number of songs "based" on what I was listening to. If I wanted to listen to random songs, I would choose to do so. This has recently caused my user experience to drop from a 5 stars to 3 stars. If the support team could answer this in a timely manner it may be appreciated.
__label__user_experience __label__bug It's a wonderful app, but it has frequent glitches. I have to uninstall and then reinstall every couple of weeks.
__label__song_selection I freaking love Spotify it is the best ever all the songs I ever wanted are all right here on Spotify thank you so much Spotify you guys rock
__label__user_experience I can't see the control to skip, pause, stop music, etc. Please fix this!
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__account This is an extraordinary app.......i would love to get premium but.... only limited platforms for payments are available.....nowadays even non popular sites give a lot of platforms......it would be more convenient if you have Google pay...... please take in note of my request ( only for that reason I've given 3 stars ....or would be giving 5💖😀)
__label__song_selection Can't play music only plays 2 song then stops 😑
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience Thing i really hate that when i try to listen to a song there's always like 10 random songs, and i can't even Skip all of them, like please just let me listen to the song 🤦🏻‍♀️
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__playlist __label__support __label__bug __label__comparison Was a great app until a week ago, for some reason it stopped working. All of my liked songs disappeared and won't play any music. I tried updating it, uninstalling it and re-downloading it but nothing works. I'll have to go back to pandora if it doesn't get fixed. Plz help
__label__song_selection Can listen to songs in the background while using other apps
__label__song_selection This is the best song selection app.
__label__advert Taking away the one star because of the advertisements
__label__song_selection I don't like it a lot when I want to play a song another song pops up.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience Great selection and easy to use.
__label__user_experience Spotify Rock's
__label__audio_quality __label__subscription_or_cost __label__song_selection __label__playlist __label__comparison Spotify does provide quality music. I use s22 and there are no lags so far. But there isn't any spatial audio support even on premium membership. Apple provides that but I guess this problem is limited to Indian customers only. Other than that, best playlists, best song selection, music releases as soon as possible. Great, just waiting for the spatial audio support.
__label__song_selection I love Spotify because it has every song in it!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__song_selection __label__advert Excellent on song selection but there's the advertisement.
__label__playlist __label__subscription_or_cost __label__user_experience __label__bug I'm rating this 2 stars whenever I keep skipping the song that is NOT in my playlist its still keeps letting me listen to another song that isn't in my playlist its quite annoying.. It's just I can't subscribe to the premium but I want to listen to my own playlist so please fix it.
__label__connectivity __label__advert __label__song_selection __label__podcast __label__user_experience __label__account My Spotify does not work if I use wifi it shows ads but doesn't let me choose the song to play as there is no "internet connection" I am not able to listen to my podcasts and am very dissatisfied with the app. I deleted the app and reinstalled it and now I can't even login. What a great app!
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience Musical lovers always like this app, it's amazing 🤗❤️.
__label__song_selection __label__playlist __label__user_experience I am so angry at Spotify! On mobile, whenever I'm trying to listen to a song, it plays something else and it makes the one song I wanted to listen to a playlist with a bunch of other songs! I am so pissed and I am uninstalling the app now🤬
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__bug __label__song_selection Please fix I pay for premium but it keeps pausing and stopping.. option to play next song is not even there!!!!
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience An app that can't play a song we like for free at the time we want is useless
__label__user_experience __label__bug __label__connectivity Frequently force close and current play button is missing, both in app and in my phone notification (also lock screen?.
__label__user_experience __label__bug __label__support __label__comparison It won't even start anymore, It will go to the standard black screen with logo, go black for a moment and then go back to that screen until my phone tells me the app isn't responding. I have reinstalled the app, checked for updates, restarted my phone, it works fine on pc and others, other people have had this issue before, so fix your app please.
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__subscription_or_cost __label__comparison Please add annual subscription, the monthly subscription is really annoying, if you don't add annual subscription, I'll shift to Spotify mod version.
__label__bug __label__user_experience __label__song_selection I don't know when the last update was but I have a lot of issues with whatever is being played just suddenly stopping. The player itself looks different or won't even show what's playing. Something is weird.
__label__bug __label__user_experience __label__connectivity __label__account After the latest update it keeps glitching, sometimes it doesn't work at all, and stopped working on my android auto, tried uninstalling and reinstalling but still does the same.
__label__connectivity __label__user_experience It worked fine for the first few weeks and stopped playing under WiFi connection, it's stupid.
__label__podcast __label__song_selection __label__playlist __label__user_experience __label__account __label__subscription_or_cost I used to love this app. It was the only place I got my podcasts and music but recently it either stops whenever it wants to or it won't stop without me uninstalling it. It also starts to play a playlist then plays a random song not on any of my playlists?!?! I have a premium account and am seriously thinking about cancelling it, it annoys me so much! Sort the problems Spotify!!! It can't just be me?!?!
__label__song_selection Worst app, search the songs but another song is playing.
__label__user_experience A great music App..,😍😍😍
__label__account I rate you 4 because I ended up having two accounts, wondering whether I'll be charged twice.
__label__playlist I cannot even listen to the music in my playlist.
__label__song_selection I literally listen to music all day I don't watch television and I'm hooked on Spotify right now
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection The app has been great, but recently it's been really buggy. Even simple tasks, like pausing the song that I'm listening to, have been a challenge.
__label__user_experience Its really good would want to listen to it more
__label__podcast __label__user_experience __label__connectivity __label__support It randomly will play the podcast without the bar used to pause or skip so I am forced to close the app. It constantly pushes my phone's connection to my PC even though I haven't connected the device (device not even avalible when I am on PC) but yet the podcast I was last litening to gets loaded and I loose what ever music I was listening to on my PC. Please contact me for more info!
__label__song_selection __label__playlist __label__user_experience The problem is that I'm trying to listen to my music but on phone there is no way to stop the randomized song option which chooses from your Playlist which doesn't sad to bad until you notice that they also added songs so play instead of your music and I've spent an hour deleting music off my Play list that I didn't even add and after I finished they added more songs so basically what I'm saying is is that I can't even listen to the songs I like when using this app.
__label__user_experience __label__playlist __label__song_selection These are issues that has gotten worse over the last few months. App continuously runs in background even when closed, and will randomly start playing. Or, app will refuse to close. App will "forget" what I have been listening to when I pause and switch to another app.
__label__account __label__song_selection __label__user_experience I was logged back into Spotify, but someone rubbish named Mick D was not taken off my home section because I had previously selected it by mistake. Please can you remove it? ❌❌❌❌❌ Stormzy ⭐❌❌❌❌ Party Rock Anthem ⭐⭐❌❌❌ AC/DC
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection Glitchy app, could be a lot more user friendly. But good library of songs if you can deal with finesse'ing your way around it from time to time
__label__song_selection It gives us the perfect songs.
__label__audio_quality __label__song_selection Good sounds, good music! Enjoy!
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__user_experience Hi 👋. I love Spotify, I received Spotify premium for free for 2 weeks. Thank you Spotify. I found it great and I will continue using Spotify until I get comfortable with the app.
__label__song_selection It holds the best music even from old times
__label__song_selection This is an amazing app 💞🦋 would love if liked songs can be played without using internet 🥺🐾🍁
__label__user_experience __label__playlist __label__song_selection __label__account This app is great and all but the fact that one can't stop shuffle if on a free account is annoying. Also, why does it play recommended songs without asking...
__label__advert Lots of ads at every 2nd song avg
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__account When I save my music to sd card, the whole app becomes unresponsive. Please tune the app so that, it only keeps the downloaded music to the sd card and cache files in the phone memory.
__label__song_selection __label__account __label__user_experience Had to reinstall the app as it won't let me download songs, I'm on premium. Now the refreshed app won't even open. Nothing but issues ever since it updated. Please fix.
__label__user_experience __label__comparison I just love this. Much better than Apple Music.
__label__song_selection Spotify, you're the best music......
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__playlist __label__support Very poor for a paid service. -The music frequently stops for a few seconds -Play/pause and skip button disappears -The shuffle function favours like 20 songs I will be contacting spotify for at least a partial refund.
__label__user_experience __label__bug It got even worse somehow. Now the app closes or crashes every 5 minutes, like clockwork, so I can't listen to ANYTHING
__label__user_experience It won't even open it's just kept loading and loading
__label__user_experience Best music app.
__label__user_experience __label__playlist __label__account It's a good app. It's accessible and easy to use, which is really amazing(◍•ᴗ•◍)❤ ..I love you Spotify. Your playlists are fantastic. I recommend you Spotify.
__label__user_experience I like the apps for Android phone and it gives me what I want
__label__song_selection Love to have so many options of songs that is old.
__label__user_experience Best music app ever.
__label__audio_quality good quality of songs
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection Easy to use and has all the songs I want.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection Use Spotify every day for hours, has everything I want and more
__label__playlist __label__song_selection Great APP! Many Playlists. I have found almost everything I have been searching for!
__label__bug Playbar disappears on regular basis. Should be fixed.
__label__connectivity __label__subscription_or_cost __label__comparison Worst app ever I just purchased premium membership and now I can't use wifi to do anything in the app always showing no internet connection. My other apps are doing fine with wifi I've been using Apple music for about 2 years and I've never face this issue I am so disappointed. Please check yourself before pay for premium.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection Its great! My issue is it isn't available in all countries, and I wish if we could download and listen offline.
__label__song_selection __label__podcast __label__comparison The music available is awesome, I have no need or desire to listen to the Podcast selection. If I could find another alternative to this(Spotify), without the annoying Podcast, I'd do it in a heartbeat.
__label__song_selection It is the best music app I ever had.
__label__song_selection Y'all can find almost every song/mashup/remixes here!!
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__bug __label__user_experience Why cant i get a premium? It has been 6 months since I got a premium but why cant i get now? Is this a bug or malfunction?
__label__advert __label__song_selection Very limited on Adverts, straight to the good music..
__label__song_selection I enjoy listening to my favorite songs.
__label__comparison excellent application more than the others.
__label__song_selection __label__playlist __label__user_experience __label__subscription_or_cost __label__account Your better off listening to music on YouTube because then at least you may actually be able to pick what song you want to play on a playlist instead of it forceing it to being random every time and sometimes it'll play stuff that's not even on your playlist and the only way to skip it is to have premium or use one of your six skips for the day. The only reason I'm keeping it is to keep track of which songs I actually like so that way I can listen to them on YouTube. would not use again
__label__song_selection Amazing music app
__label__song_selection Best Music Streaming App
__label__comparison __label__song_selection __label__user_experience Pc version which I used on a tablet was absolutely amazing but the mobile version is not satisfying, can't even pick a specific song to play and I can only skip 6 times? This user experience makes me want to reconsider my choices.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection Spotify is the best app that I used the songs are amazing
__label__advert __label__user_experience The ads are ridiculous!!! I'm a free listener and every two songs there is 5 commercials and it's dumb so I am going to stop using this app!!!!!!!!!
__label__user_experience It's easy to use and also user friendly
__label__playlist __label__account __label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__song_selection Should section off playlist we created from added playlists. It constantly disconnect me from my account and my user experience isn't smooth or updated. Even when my user experience is visible, what they are playing isn't updated. The song selection that isn't English, example japanese or chinese have reduced significantly.. Even English ones are no exception.
__label__song_selection I love it. All I can say is. It has all I needed to hear. ❤️❤️❤️
__label__song_selection __label__comparison __label__user_experience Would rate better if I could choose the songs I'd actually want to listen to, the Xbox/Tablet/Web client are all far better than this junk.
__label__song_selection __label__playlist __label__bug __label__advert I don't know if this is a glitch, but I can't even choose the song I want to play when I want to listen to my playlist. It just plays some random song. I tried to play lofi music to relax and it played We Don't Talk About Bruno. Its kinda annoying that I have a small chance it'll ACTUALLY play the song I want. I'm still gonna keep trying though. I also keep getting ads for period pads which is kinda gross 🤨
__label__user_experience __label__support My spotify took too long to open. I tried clearing the data but it still doesn't work and operate. Pls help fix this.
__label__connectivity __label__user_experience __label__bug Stopps playing for no apparent reason. No more dropdown commands. Its still buggy which is kind of incredible for such a big company. Shame
__label__song_selection __label__playlist __label__user_experience If you want to discover new music than this app is for you. Because it will add to your Playlists, it does not give a choice in the matter. I understand what they were meaning when they did this but it can get annoying. If they fixed this I would like it more.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience It's awesome having all the songs you can think of in 1 spot and the lyrics playing along is the best feature. Love it
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__advert I ain't gonna buy premium try putting as much as advertisements u want!
__label__song_selection It's a pretty good app to select songs on.
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__account I recently purchased Spotify premium and after my subscription was over I canceled it cause I didn't need it anymore but after that it logged me out of my account and won't let me log back in or reset my password.
__label__user_experience This is good app and easy to use
__label__song_selection Luv this app but I found songs on YouTube but ain't on Spotify little confused bout that but over all luv it💜💙💜
__label__song_selection __label__connectivity It is a wonderful app. It has all. Kind of songs and can be operated on both PC and mobiles.
__label__advert __label__audio_quality __label__subscription_or_cost __label__user_experience This app is easily the best music streaming app when you pay for premium. No adverts, offline downloads, great recommendations, unbelievably high audio quality, and a very user friendly UI. Without premium, you have relentless adverts, lesser audio quality, no offline downloads, you're not allowed to ever turn off shuffle play. I get most of these, but when you lock playing albums in order behind a subscription_or_cost, I think you're getting a little money hungry. Just pay premium and you'll get your money's worth.
__label__user_experience Fun fun fun!
__label__song_selection I just really like for the music
__label__subscription_or_cost It's bad in the sense because it provides all benefits just in the paid version. I mean to say some benefits also provide to the free version.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__audio_quality At first the app is good but now I can't play the full songs and the format has change which is very confusing. Plus it only plays the preview lol
__label__podcast __label__bug __label__song_selection Constantly cuts out podcasts and only shows playing song about half the time good for music but a lot of bugs.
__label__song_selection The Best music streaming service
__label__song_selection This "intuitive" app is worthless. The only good thing is its song selection, and it's barely that. Update: still worthless. 7/7/2022
__label__advert __label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__account Spotify is the best music app ever. It give only one advert of 30 seconds and you can listen uninterrupted songs for 30 min.❤️ And this app has quite a smooth user experience 🙂 must create an account.
__label__user_experience __label__bug Its not opening after many try of re installing
__label__bug When I open it, it just stuck on the logo.
__label__playlist __label__song_selection __label__bug You should be glad i rated this 2 stars. Why? Because i made a playlist and random songs keep playing, i literally have like 10+ songs in my playlist and i didn't hear any of them, Please..Fix it. also When I listen to songs they just randomly stop, Kindly fix the bugs^^ thanks
__label__user_experience __label__advert __label__support __label__bug I really liked this app but for 4 or 5 days the app gets permanently stuck after repeatedly playing the same ad (Clash Podcast). This issue has made a great app unusable - will revise stars if/when issue fixed.
__label__user_experience __label__bug __label__subscription_or_cost __label__account Not reliable enough to pay for. If you're willing to put up with crashes and times where it just won't open, fine. Just don't pay for it expecting the paid subscription to change anything; it doesn't.
__label__advert Inappropriate and irrelevant advertising that isn't kid friendly.
__label__song_selection What a Beautiful Beautiful Beautiful song about my JESUS who gives us Excess Love that we don't deserve. Thanks Mercy Blessings on you and yours 🙏💜.
__label__song_selection __label__playlist __label__user_experience I got really good music I got a really good library of some really good sounds really good artist I'm good with it
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__advert Worst app .. With 10 minutes music and lots of ads
__label__podcast __label__song_selection __label__connectivity The app won't let you access the music and podcasts you've already downloaded to your phone when there is no service. What's the point of downloading them to your phone if you can't listen to them offline?
__label__song_selection Great for offline music and has a wide variety.
__label__comparison __label__subscription_or_cost Hard to rate compared to other offering but I like Spotify and it's a good deal.
__label__user_experience __label__subscription_or_cost I use Spotify every single day. Also get Premium.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__bug I love Spotify and all the music it brings me, but recently I've experienced trouble using the lock screen widget (it no longer exists), so I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app, now the app won't even open!
__label__account __label__song_selection Yeah, apparently, you can got "hacked" here. People can add songs to your "liked song" without confirmation.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection Easy to use and enjoyable. The music available is fantastic.
__label__podcast __label__bug Love the app, but the player bar on the bottom frequently disappears, leaving podcasts continually running without a way to control them unless I force stop & re-open the app. Will rate 5 stars when fixed.
__label__user_experience __label__comparison Keeps putting a push in my notification area even though I blocked notifications. Uninstalled. Play Music is much better anyway.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__connectivity App takes forever to load...like over 1 min. Program is very slow to start playing, but works after. Don't know if it is because it is downloading songs or if it is a memory hog. I have my songs on an SD card.
__label__user_experience Exploring is an awesome experience.
__label__song_selection Just awesome app for music lovers
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__playlist __label__connectivity __label__account __label__support __label__bug I overall enjoy Spotify because I can download with premium. Sadly I can't play it on my phone right now because my phone updated and Spotify just has empty playlists and nothing works. It says I'm not connected to the internet and I am. I have done everything imaginable including deleting it, logging out, Etc and nothing is worked to fix it. I don't know if this is the phone update issue or Spotify hasn't caught up to the updates yet.
__label__user_experience __label__bug __label__song_selection __label__account Spotify has been extremely buggy on my Samsung S22+. The biggest problem is when I open Spotify, whatever was last playing or is currently playing is not displayed in the player. It's just missing. Closing and reopening Spotify used to fix that. Lately it will persist through attempts to fix it. Has a lot of problems accessing "offline" content I specifically downloaded to listen to when offline. Displaying wrong dates shows were last updated 😕 Fix this buggy app!
__label__user_experience __label__support My Spotify is not opening... When i open it, it only shows the Spotify icon Please rectify this problem
__label__user_experience Excellent all around. Thanks!
__label__account __label__song_selection __label__user_experience This is just disappointing...I mean I can't listen to any of my favorite songs without a premium subscription! Why? This is not done. If you want to listen to songs for free then this might not be the ideal app for that...too disappointing.
__label__playlist They would add their songs to MY PLAYLIST! I can't make a playlist without having songs I didn't put on it on.
__label__user_experience An app worth listening to.
__label__user_experience __label__subscription_or_cost __label__advert __label__song_selection __label__account Well I love this app the platform is so accessible and easy but mainly if you have Spotify premium like if you don't have it you usually have to play an ad or a couple to play 1 song or it plays a song in the same genre. But with premium you can download songs for when you're offline and no ads! It's amazing if you have premium
__label__audio_quality __label__connectivity It was a great app except now it cuts in and out sometimes for some reason. Sometimes it won't even play. Please fix this
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection If used properly. A great app to share with YOUR family and friends.
__label__user_experience __label__comparison I've had Spotify for about 2 to 3 weeks and it's seems great and is better than I thought it was going to be.
__label__user_experience __label__account The app stopped working and will not open past the logo screen. Have tried everything for days and still can't even login.
__label__song_selection Best app all songs available easily
__label__user_experience __label__advert Everything is great but ads are annoying sometimes I get 3 to 4 ads continuously.
__label__bug __label__account __label__playlist __label__song_selection Love using the app but suddenly it stopped working, constantly giving an error message saying something went wrong. Despite trying multiple solutions including signing out and back in, clearing data, and more, the issue remains unresolved. The problem persists even when accessing playlists or trying to listen to music. Hoping for a fix soon.
__label__podcast __label__connectivity __label__advert __label__account __label__bug This app has been acting up lately pausing for long periods during podcasts and won't play via Bluetooth in my car. Also will play the same ad over and over and I'm unable to skip through it and get back to whatever I was listening to. I've had to Uninstall and re install numerous times the past few weeks. Please fix!
__label__song_selection __label__audio_quality __label__user_experience I would rate this a 4 because when I try to play a song, it puts a different song on and my settings are default. However, these songs are good, so 5.
__label__account __label__user_experience __label__connectivity The app logged me out of my account, I've had to update my password and now the app stays on a screen with the logo and won't open at all. I have uninstalled and downloaded again and updated and it won't open.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience It's not bad.. Wish they'd move the "hide this song" from in between "liked" and "add to playlist".. Because it just makes sense! Often hit it by accident.
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__account __label__support Charged me for 3 months after I canceled my subscription, and would only refund 1 month. No customer service to phone, shotty online support. Not impressed
__label__advert Way too many ads
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience Every thing is perfect but please show the lyrics in the language in which the song is, and not any other language.
__label__user_experience __label__bug I can't open the app anymore since I updated it.
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__user_experience I used to love this app. I pay for the premium version. With the latest update I can no longer pause, rewind or fast forward.
__label__playlist I love spotify except that they keep adding songs to MY playlists.
__label__song_selection Spotify is the best hands down music app that is on the web I'll never use another app for my music.
__label__user_experience Not Working its showing only black screen
__label__bug Keeps pausing on playback.
__label__song_selection __label__comparison There are some songs that aren't available on Spotify that I feel should be there but overall, Spotify is one of the best out there.
__label__song_selection We couldn't even download any music for free.
__label__connectivity __label__song_selection __label__account __label__user_experience __label__subscription_or_cost Linkable to many services and devices. Selections somewhat diverse. Convenient with offline downloads (paid)《BUT》Poor playlist randomizer. Wasteful efforts on unnecessary features, for example: Strange Things mode. A feature only experienced on a single page? Who watches the screen while listening? But the main reason I can't give above 3 is they don't pay artist's a fair share of the profits. So much so that many musicians boycott Spotify.
__label__comparison Way better than Apple music or Amazon music
__label__user_experience __label__bug It wouldn't go past the loading screen even after trying to restart my device and uninstalling and reinstalling the app.
__label__user_experience The play and pause button are not coming on.
__label__song_selection __label__connectivity Not displaying current song being played. Can't use on multiple devices at the same time.
__label__playlist __label__connectivity You guys are driving me cryz, i found great Vybz from your app. I also recommend you add offline playlists in case of network barriers and bundle depletions
__label__user_experience So now this app disappeared from my phone and won't install.
__label__song_selection I love it, all my music, when I want it.
__label__advert The ads are too long..
__label__playlist __label__bug Sometimes the playlist does not open and then again I have to download it or maybe update again after the given update.
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__advert Premium is worth it. Its trash commercials over and over again if you don't pay for Premium.
__label__user_experience __label__bug __label__support This app has been terrible the last few months. It stops randomly, you can't stop things playing without force closing the app, and the play bar disappears regularly. When is any of this getting fixed? This is a paid app, not a free one. There's no point any more. I'm taking my business elsewhere.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__bug Play/Pause bar missing. Songs will stop playing by themselves. Have uninstalled and reinstalled 3 times in 3 days. Fixes the problem for a few hours then the glitches start again.
__label__song_selection Awesome music
__label__account __label__subscription_or_cost Have been paid but can't work
__label__podcast __label__user_experience __label__bug __label__subscription_or_cost The only reason I have Spotify is for the Joe Rogan Experience and it's almost not worth it. The app constantly crashes, changes what I'm listening to, and the way it works is trash. I have to uninstall and re-install this app at least twice a month. I honestly can't believe people pay for this trash.
__label__user_experience __label__bug Could the app be any more glitchy. Also if you could crash a little more than 2 to 3 times a day. That would be great. Thanks
__label__song_selection Nice app for song downloading....
__label__song_selection __label__audio_quality Bundle of collection and quality 😍🥰😇❣️💚
__label__user_experience __label__audio_quality I don't like this app cuz I play bad liar it open a wrong sound😢
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__support This song selection service itself is great, but the app is so poorly created for user experience. Every other update, something breaks and I have to downgrade it. (potential security risk).
__label__song_selection Best free song selection ever!
__label__user_experience __label__bug __label__audio_quality I have always loved the Spotify app. And I have always been impressed with the improvements made over the years. But here lately when I go to turn my volume up or down when I'm on the app. My phone bogs down and almost freezes. When it does this it won't let me do anything until the volume slider is gone. It acts like I get 5fps when I hit my volume.
__label__song_selection __label__audio_quality __label__advert The song selection is great and it has great audio quality but I had 11 adverts in a row. I usually don't mind two or three adverts but 11 ?? seriously? this is unacceptable. Please do something about it, thank you.
__label__advert __label__song_selection __label__playlist It's great and all, a good amount of ads but 6 skips per hour? THAT'S STUPID, I CAN'T LISTEN TO MY FAV SONGS AND ONE OF THEM DOESN'T SING THE EXACT SONG. And STOP adding songs to my playlist!!! You're ruining it!!!!
__label__song_selection This app helps to release my stress by listening to wonderful song selection
__label__playlist __label__user_experience You can't listen to a song without going on a playlist and you can't start over the song.
__label__playlist Stop putting songs in my playlist
__label__user_experience __label__audio_quality Accessible, best app
__label__song_selection It's a great app. Whatever music I want whenever I want it.
__label__subscription_or_cost I love it so much I'm paying for it lol
__label__user_experience Love Spotify, I started by myself first, but now I have converted my whole family!
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience It's okay but just I don't listen to much songs. It's amazing.
__label__subscription_or_cost I've been using spotify since I was 12 and it's been alright. The one thing I'd change is making people pay to get rid of ads.
__label__user_experience Having an issue where the app hides the ability to skip, pause and so on.
__label__user_experience __label__audio_quality Easy to use but sound quality is so so
__label__song_selection 100% has everything!
__label__playlist __label__song_selection The app is great. But I don't like how the playlist has to be shuffled. What if I want to listen to a particular song? I can only skip 6 times an hour. I really dislike that.
__label__advert Multiple ads every 10 minutes.
__label__song_selection __label__playlist When you select a song, it doesn't play it but the next one in the playlist. Please fix.
__label__song_selection __label__playlist Sometimes my spotify plays random music not in my playlist
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__subscription_or_cost Edit: This changed on mine (THANKFULLY) so I'm changing my initial rating of 2 stars to 4 stars! The removal of "pressing play in liked songs and having the songs reshuffle themselves" in place of "pressing play in liked songs plays the last song listened to in liked songs" is very frustrating. I liked being able to click the button again and again to have a random order of the songs I like. I don't always know what song I'm in the mood for. I have premium and this is disappointing.
__label__podcast __label__bug __label__song_selection __label__user_experience Constantly crashes. Won't resume the podcast I was listening to. Instead starts a random episode. Almost impossible to use.
__label__bug __label__song_selection __label__comparison Garbage. Crashes all the time. Downloaded music doesn't play without signal. I'm going back to SoundCloud.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__podcast Spotify is great. Great song selection and easy to use. They provide a great amount of variety for music. Also the podcasts are vast. Lots of options and things to learn.
__label__account __label__subscription_or_cost __label__support Deleted my account and still charged me for subscription that is so unfair and now I can't even unsubscribe
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__bug So now we can't fast forward or rewind anything we are listening to? What happened to the little bar to do that with? Also even after the new update it still does not allow you to select the next track from the lock screen like a pop-up window. U have to fully unlock the phone to change the track, please fix issue it is very annoying having to unlock the phone to change the music.
__label__advert __label__song_selection Why are adverts being played in the middle of songs? Poor song selection on this platform.
__label__audio_quality __label__podcast __label__user_experience __label__support __label__subscription_or_cost __label__bug I pay for Premium and the app always shuts down on it's own in the middle of a song or podcast and then when you open the app back up, it doesn't have the option to pause or play so to stop whatever is playing you have to close out of the app. I contacted customer service, they told me the only way to "fix" it is to uninstall the app and redownload it. This happens multiple times a week, nearly every day. What am I actually paying for?!
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__account Good music app. Missing some songs I love. Charged me wrong once.
__label__audio_quality __label__connectivity __label__account __label__song_selection __label__user_experience Intermittent audio on all devices using Samsung phones (2 different models) and different BT devices. I uninstalled Spotify and then reinstalled. So far so good. Spotify remembered my library so l am happy l didn't have to recreate. Spotify: Why don't you have a user note about this issue. Enough people are having the same problem.
__label__song_selection Great app for music.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience I just can't understand how it works He doesn't give the song when I ask for it He puts a lot of songs in front of me and I can't get over it 💀
__label__bug __label__support Get better at bugs but you're alright for the meantime.
__label__song_selection __label__bug __label__connectivity __label__user_experience so far this is the best song selection app I have used rarely crash's Plays offline has a multitude of user experiences and functionalities and very easy to maneuver around. Thanks so much guy's and gal's for all your hard work
__label__audio_quality Good quality music
__label__song_selection __label__podcast __label__subscription_or_cost __label__comparison If you are into music or podcasts then they got you. Got more than you could want. More than the others. And better pricing than the others. Top shelf all day.
__label__subscription_or_cost Best subscription 🙌 👏 you get what you pay for
__label__song_selection Best app ever to hear music.
__label__user_experience __label__playlist __label__song_selection Its a nice app for listening to music but half the time it will play "suggested songs" if i wanted to listen to those songs i would listen to them but i want to listen to the playlist not those songs.
__label__playlist __label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__support __label__bug I can never get it to play my playlist if I try and click on it it will play music close to it and I didn't want that I've been trying so hard on the mobile app and it just sucks please fix it it's super annoying and I am never downloading this app ever again I do not recommend
__label__podcast Stop telling me I might like podcasts. They. All. Suck.
__label__user_experience __label__bug __label__connectivity 5 stars WHEN it works. So glitchy following the latest updates- widget doesn't work; randomly stops playing; no control bar; can't stop or pause play without exiting app entirely; sometimes available for car sometimes not.
__label__advert __label__subscription_or_cost Love it, though I wish the ads weren't so long, I'm too lazy to buy something to remove them, and they aren't that bad.
__label__user_experience Please add more items on profile & setting.
__label__user_experience __label__bug __label__account Whenever I open my Spotify it just freezes the moment where the logo shows up and becomes unresponsive at all. I tried uninstalling it many times, cleared my caches, freed up some space on my phone and it still doesn't respond and just freezes the moment the logo shows up when you open the app. I logged out on my Spotify and it just happened all of a sudden, I'm disappointed.
__label__user_experience __label__podcast __label__account __label__subscription_or_cost This app worked perfectly for years until I decided to try the free trial. Now my control bar has disappeared, my played podcasts are coming up as unplayed, I've lost podcasts I was subscribed to. I won't be renewing my subscription if the payment doesn't even work.
__label__user_experience __label__subscription_or_cost __label__bug App has poor performance. Monthly payments for such poor service is not satisfying! If I'm spending money on something, it should always work properly and be free from bugs.
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__account Really enjoyed the free trial. Got my son to upgrade his account to a premium family account.
__label__advert I've used Spotify off and on for quite some time and I like it but if I had to say one thing negative I would say turn the volume down on your ads and that's it!
__label__playlist __label__connectivity Please add the ability to play your whole playlist and not have to shuffle to different songs and add the ability to play your whole playlist on Alexa devices through the Alex skill please thank you so much.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience Love the different station and ease of use to find the artists and songs I like 👍
__label__song_selection Love it!! Has any and all my old Rock favorites, Like Frank Marino, and Pat Travers, as well 90's Grunge.
__label__user_experience It would be nice if the user experience wasn't so restrictive.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection Good app, doesn't let me unhide songs for some reason
__label__user_experience App won't open on my new phone.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__account __label__subscription_or_cost Pausing- app is broken and keeps stopping. The pause/play/skip bar is missing. I've uninstall and reinstalled and still no difference. Time to cancel premium
__label__bug __label__user_experience New update has problems with pausing and continuing play
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__account It's a good app where you can listen to music but sometimes I don't understand it:)
__label__user_experience __label__subscription_or_cost __label__account Easy to use, nice that premium and paying in general is optional
__label__account __label__song_selection __label__comparison I love Spotify! I've had it for years and couldn't be any more pleased! Look out Pandora!
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection When trying to listen to downloaded music offline the app endlessly buffers when you select your library, very frustrating.
__label__advert I like it don't like the advertising duration tho
__label__account __label__song_selection Very nicee but Someone hacked my account and every time it plays we're no strangers to love. You know the rules and so do I. You know commitments what I'm thinkin of, you wouldnt get this from any other guy!♡ I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
__label__user_experience My Spotify is not working.
__label__user_experience __label__subscription_or_cost __label__support I can't even use the app. It loads up just the symbol then sits there and goes no where idk what the problem is and none of the trouble shooting tactics are working. I've payed for premium so shouldn't I get to use the F-ing app. I would do 0 outta 5 if I could.
__label__playlist __label__bug __label__account __label__support __label__subscription_or_cost App won't reflect my playlists. Has been updated. Won't let me update my screen name either. No available support for these issues either. Remind me why I pay for premium again?!
__label__bug __label__user_experience __label__song_selection UPDATED: the recent Android version is very buggy. Random pausing and display errors with the player not showing so you can't interact with the song requiring a hard close/open. Seems to be a common new complaint
__label__podcast __label__song_selection __label__advert __label__subscription_or_cost JRE is truly the only reason I use Spotify. Pretty good, you can find and listen to almost anything. Ads stink, especially the ads from Spotify trying to get me to pay for premium so I don't have to listen to ads.
__label__song_selection __label__subscription_or_cost It's a good song selection app but I wish the subscription costs applied to high schoolers not just college.
__label__user_experience __label__audio_quality __label__support __label__comparison __label__bug Despite force stops, restarts and reinstalls, persistent problems of a disappearing play bar and playback randomly stopping. I recently got a Samsung phone and apparently this is a known problem. Please fix or I'll take my money elsewhere!
__label__bug Completely bugged after update
__label__user_experience __label__bug Wrong direction, this last update was the worst in several years. Broke all sorts of things in the Android app experience!
__label__connectivity Not good l can't listen offline why can you make it possible
__label__connectivity __label__account __label__subscription_or_cost __label__user_experience The app keeps asking me to connect my devices(assume this is for data harvesting), why do I need to connect my device if it is already paired over BT? Debating on cancelling my membership and uninstalling if this prompt persists.
__label__user_experience __label__advert Everything is good but this app shows too many ads... It's just Irritating...
__label__bug __label__advert __label__song_selection __label__user_experience Wish I could rate this junk lower. Garbage app, pauses, fails to load sometimes, full of ads, freezes, limited revenue for artists, trashy interface etc.
__label__user_experience __label__connectivity Mobile app is rather good but on wearOS the app is very limited. I can't even search for anything.
__label__user_experience __label__bug __label__song_selection __label__support Stopped working after the most recent update won't even open 4 out of 5 times the one to two times it does open I get a blank screen the next time it opens I can't get into my library. I've uninstalled it and reinstalled it twice I still can't get it to play every time I open it. As of July 1st 2022
__label__advert Stop showing these BTS ads in background
__label__connectivity __label__song_selection Absolutely love this app. I have a very interesting device that has a Bluetooth and have paired my phone and able to pick out any song with guest and sing and dance with this gadget that changes colors and has a speaker. Using Spotify puts so many genres at your fingertips to keep the party rocking!!!
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__song_selection I paid last month for Premium Family & my wife. Unfortunately she past away two weeks ago. Love the music selection, but I'll keep her phone too for when family come to visit.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__playlist I haven't had any problems with this app. I have been using it for a long time. I would just like to suggest that there should be an option to select a few songs at once to add to a playlist. Sometimes it is a bit frustrating to choose songs individually.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__audio_quality __label__connectivity If there is a way to sort downloaded songs by artist that would catch you guys up with 15 year old music players. Also can you manage to show album art properly for a whole week straight? And the audio doesn't always show up now and whatever is causing that also keeps me from connecting with my car or earbuds. Just don't be trash for 3 months straight. Dare ya
__label__song_selection __label__podcast __label__user_experience Handy in the car or in the shower for whatever song selection I'm feeling or cool podcast I want to discover. Can't imagine having to make do without it.
__label__user_experience __label__advert __label__subscription_or_cost Been away for a bit, app got worse! I seriously don't get how this can happen. Every time I open the app I get stuck in the ad loops! Like seriously how many ads do I have to listen to. I have to close the app and reopen it. Talk about making it so u subscribe. I'll definitely be finding another app. Horrible!
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__bug __label__connectivity Songs stop playing randomly and over the last two days the player bar disappeared so I can't pause / skip / etc. I have to force close the app to make playback stop. Works again after I restarted phone.
__label__advert __label__subscription_or_cost Cyber beggers, begging for premium subscription in between every songs.
__label__podcast __label__bug __label__user_experience __label__song_selection I now can't pause music or podcasts. I don't know if there has been recent update, but this has been happening since yesterday. I uninstalled the app yesterday then reinstalled this morning. It was working fine until now. Won't use app again. This is a pain in the neck.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__audio_quality Was fine until like 6-9 months ago. Podcast player keeps disappearing, so I can't pause or skip through songs correctly. This sometimes causes the music to stop randomly as well. Really frustrating. Using Samsung s10e
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__account It would be really nice if Spotify could bring out the feature of using UPI for the subscriptions for premium like Netflix. This would really help people like me who wanna take out a subscription but don't have a visa card. Please do consider in the near future!
__label__song_selection __label__subscription_or_cost __label__user_experience __label__comparison Good music app! Sure, the Spotify premium only features are annoying, but it gives me music. It's functional, unlike Pandora. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
__label__song_selection __label__playlist __label__connectivity It reduces my storage to be fully songs that I can make a playlist n play it online 💯
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection I love Spotify I use it all the time it bring so much joy into my life
__label__bug __label__user_experience __label__song_selection With each Update it gets worst, Sometimes the search bar doesn't appear, Sometimes search does not load, Sometimes the music plays but there is no bar indication...
__label__song_selection __label__audio_quality __label__advert __label__subscription_or_cost it was phenomenal, always suggested the songs I prefer, perfect quality, although without Spotify premium, it's pretty annoying getting ads and not being able to play the songs I want too
__label__song_selection Great variety of music!
__label__user_experience __label__connectivity Really good to use, I've been using Spotify a lot in the last 2½ years, Haven't had any issues with it (besides losing signal every now and then when in the car - as a passenger)
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection Keeps pausing on it's own every couple of seconds for no god damn reason. If I could just scroll from the top of my screen and press the play button I wouldn't mind, but I have to enter the app again to press play just for it to pause again.
__label__advert Awesome app but too many ads 😒
__label__user_experience __label__connectivity __label__account Works fine on mobile, if I'm on WiFi no matter which one it just won't load anything, I tried everything, the app has all permissions, still nothing!
__label__advert __label__song_selection Overall it is good but the only problem is that the ads. They just take too long to play the next song you want to play like 3-4 ads will happen in between of you listening to what you want to listen.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__playlist won't let me play songs I want, and also shuffles songs when I want a specific song ALSO ALSO IT "ADDS MUSIC I MIGHT LIKE" I HATE IT, WHY CANT I HAVE JUST A FEW SONGS THAT I WANT
__label__user_experience __label__playlist The service itself is great but the mobile app is infintely annoying. Most frequently I just listen to my "Liked Songs" playlist. I choose a song to listen to in the car then close the app when I get out. Anyone with a brain would think I'd want to continue listening from where I left off, right? So why is it that when I reopen the app, even if it's only been closed for a minute, my playlist has jumped ahead by about 100 songs? This is incredibly irritating. I would give 5 stars if not for this.
__label__song_selection __label__bug Amazing app for those who love music 🎶.... But sometimes there will be some bugs... But not all the time 😉... If you are reading reviews to download this app then just go and download this application ☺️👍.
__label__song_selection Best place to listen to music too!!
__label__podcast Good content for podcast.
__label__song_selection __label__subscription_or_cost 3 stars until I see an update to fix this issue. I love this app, I've been a paid subscriber for years, but for the love of God if I have "unedited" songs in my liked songs, Do Not! Switch them out for edited versions!...I'm 30 years old and if I wanted to hear the edited version of "gin and juice" I probably wouldn't be listening to r & b in the first place, please fix this has happened to me so many times!
__label__user_experience Excellent 👌... Good for burning calories....
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection I can't turn off shuffle I don't have the icon
__label__audio_quality __label__song_selection __label__bug I've had Spotify for about 5 years now and I'm a premium user. I love the audio quality and the song selections they provide. The only problem, which is why I'm giving it 4 stars, is that it keeps having bugs when I'm skipping songs. It will either not play or keep reverting to the previous song, or just skip three songs ahead. Other than that, it's a great app.
__label__bug __label__account App is amazing but after the recent update I'm unable to login to my profile. App won't open it gets stuck at the launch doesn't show any fields for email address and password. Hope they fix the bug ASAP
__label__audio_quality This app is worth its keep. Have enjoyed it so far. Hope they can improve on the audio quality.
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__playlist __label__song_selection __label__song_selection It's fun and free, but because of the auto shuffle I can't listen to a single song, even recommended songs I have to wait and listen to 5 other songs just to listen to a song I might not even like.
__label__user_experience Very useful and enjoyable app.
__label__comparison __label__song_selection I was once a Deezer user but when I tried this app, I have been so addicted to music.
__label__user_experience Love Spotify, it's great.
__label__user_experience __label__bug __label__advert __label__song_selection __label__podcast __label__connectivity Worked fantastic on mobile until recent update. It will take a short time to load (usually seamless), but then the controls do not appear after selecting a song. Don't know if that has to do with an ad that always plays? Can't see which one, no controls or album/ad view. After a few songs it will cut off. This time it crashed after 2 songs. Addendum: same issue with podcasts, even if an advert doesn't play first--no controls, cuts off unexpectedly. Happens on WiFi or cell data.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__playlist Hey, can you give us an option to just randomly play a song, either from any of the playlists or from your suggestions for me or any random song and not just the last played song, from the home page upon app load? More like the Surprise me option in Netflix?
__label__song_selection Very Good Music App
__label__connectivity Brilliant especially on Bluetooth
__label__user_experience __label__playlist __label__song_selection __label__connectivity the app is pretty ok but the newish design changes are annoying and intrusive. I just want all MY playlists in one place which doesn't need me to add filters or whatever. adding and removing songs is a chore and in general there seems to be a tendency to adding unnecessary and ugly buttons everywhere. Also, why is the basic menu laggy? do we need WiFi constantly to just pull up the tab to add or remove from playlist. The recommendations and song selections etc are very good though.
__label__song_selection Best music experience ever
__label__song_selection It adds songs that I don't want hear!
__label__user_experience I can't use my spotify, I don't know what happened.
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__advert Any options left for students who cannot afford premium and have to deal with double unskippable ads?
__label__song_selection Perfect music app!
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__bug __label__podcast __label__support Usually love Spotify, but recently been having problems with it! After about 15 minutes of playing something it just cuts off, radio silence. When opening app, it takes a long time to respond, doesn't show you what you were listening to so end up having to find episode/song and play from beginning. The other day the whole app just wouldn't open at all?? Something has happened in the recent updates that has made it really buggy and laggy.
__label__song_selection __label__advert Good music so many ads
__label__user_experience Strongly recommend this app. Really enjoying it.
__label__song_selection Has all my favorite music!!
__label__song_selection This is the best app for songs, I really love it.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience Superb app. Whenever I feel upset or tired, I just listen to songs on this app. It immediately lifts my mood and helps in alleviating my tensions. Thank you, Spotify.
__label__user_experience __label__audio_quality __label__connectivity The only issue I have is the user experience, it works on my phone really nice but when I transfer to my audio system or connect it to my car, it doesn't work at all.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience Some songs are unplayable😒 Please introduce the light theme also🙂
__label__song_selection __label__advert __label__user_experience __label__comparison I used to love it because I could play my favorite tracks anytime. The ads were annoying yet bearable. However, recently, I haven't been able to even open the app. Whenever I try to open Spotify, it just kicks me out. Currently I'm using an alternative. I might leave a better review next time if this is fixed.
__label__connectivity __label__bug When I share it in snapchat the thumbnail appears twice and the link appears only once with the image I can't delete that so please fix this problem asap.
__label__user_experience __label__support Totally unusable since last update. Tried troubleshooting for days now....still getting nothing. Very frustrating Spotify and Samsung Galaxy A20!!
__label__advert Lot of ads
__label__user_experience Very good app for people of all age group and excellent for senior citizen.
__label__audio_quality Nice app for listening sounds
__label__song_selection Amazing collection from old to new
__label__user_experience I like it. Its easy to use.
__label__advert __label__subscription_or_cost Too many ads and if they could add the download feature for free that would be cool.
__label__advert __label__user_experience Just a very great app......love it and proudly recommend it too......there are ads but it's ok....np..this app has helped to overcome my sadness and also entertained me in every moment of life...
__label__playlist __label__song_selection WHY DID YOU REMOVE THE THING WHERE YOU CAN LISTEN TO THE MUSIC A BIT BEFORE PUTTING ON YOUR PLAYLIST
__label__audio_quality __label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__comparison Completely different from the web version, good audio quality yet any song selection Is completely random and you have 6 daily skips, can't get around it by playing single songs too. Overall the user experience is O.K. but the pc/computer web version is way better than the app.
__label__podcast __label__bug __label__user_experience __label__audio_quality App crashes constantly, the media bar disappears when playing music or podcasts and then I can't pause things, and the sound will randomly turn itself down while listening to music (not related to another notification appearing on the phone). This app is trash.
__label__song_selection __label__advert __label__user_experience It's a super cool app, you will get all the songs you want. It does include adverts but performs amazingly well even in a low connectivity range.
__label__user_experience __label__bug Recently had started stopping randomly when screen is locked. Also the play bar at the bottom disappears a lot of the time so the only way for me to stop a song is to shut down the entire app and start again. Lots of glitches, not great.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection I totally recommend you best music app ever it's really worth it 😊😊😊😊😊
__label__user_experience Love this app, it makes me feel better when something happened.
__label__user_experience This app functions remarkably well and I don't have any issues with it. Really amazing.
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__user_experience Good if you have a subscription, without it the user experience is kind of poor.
__label__podcast __label__song_selection __label__user_experience The App runs like a**. Every time I reopen it when I want to resume a podcast or song, the player disappears and the pages load for a minute or more. Every other app on my phone works fine.
__label__user_experience __label__playlist __label__connectivity Spotify is nice app except I can't get into my playlist and it loads too slow .
__label__comparison I would say it was great 1yr ago but now it is the equivalent to apple music.
__label__playlist __label__bug __label__song_selection __label__user_experience ! It would be nice if one could sort the songs in one's own playlist manuel or after genres. -Sometimes I have the feeling that the app is a little bit buggy or weird because sometimes it doesn't let me put songs in repeat. +But all in one it's a nice app.
__label__song_selection This is a very good app. I like this app very much. There are all types of songs. Thank you so much for this app.
__label__song_selection __label__subscription_or_cost You need to fix this I can't choose my own music and I have family premium... Fix this please
__label__audio_quality Good sound quality ❤️❤️
__label__user_experience
__label__user_experience __label__comparison Great app and Spotify is the best
__label__song_selection __label__support __label__user_experience Best App as it , Provides a wide range of Songs , BGMs and Also supported Background Music , But it will Be better if we can Clip from these songs And listen those clips
__label__song_selection Playlists are the same song you already have...... In a playlist.
__label__podcast __label__bug __label__user_experience __label__connectivity Podcast video disappears randomly and doesn't show up even after force stopping the app. Terrible UI and I'm using android.
__label__user_experience This is amazing. I really like it💜💜 #spotify💜💜
__label__song_selection __label__bug Spotify needs some help after using for a few weeks. It previewed only, I mean the song stops after 10 seconds. I tried really hard 😅 but it was broken.
__label__podcast __label__user_experience __label__connectivity I keep wanting to use this app for podcast and everytime I get discouraged. This time, I'm listening to podcast fine but I cannot pause it at all. The control to see what I'm playing is not there. Only way to stop it is to force stop it. I'll try again at some point but it's pretty unusable for me. Also, the controls don't translate to my car when I connect over Bluetooth. I'll update when these aren't issues.
__label__playlist __label__song_selection I love Spotify, especially how it suggests other songs when I'm editing a playlist.
__label__account why won't it let me in? it's been like this for two days, fix it.
__label__user_experience __label__support Would not open no matter what I tried, spent about 2 hours trying to fix it. :( It was pretty good when it did work.
__label__user_experience __label__subscription_or_cost __label__advert It sure has improved a lot compared to the earlier days, however I would love to see a better subscription or cost policy for me to opt in and avoid the adverts.
__label__bug __label__user_experience Compared to the desktop app, this app is terrible. Bugs everywhere, too many extra "features" being added while the core functionality gets worse. For example regularly the play/stop buttons just simply disappear. Only way to stop the audio is forcing closing the app. This doesn't happen on other audio apps. "Offline mode" doesn't work, you could download something and get on a plane and the file won't play.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience You can find amazing songs! You can find your favourite artist.
__label__bug __label__podcast __label__account __label__song_selection Please fix the dozens of bugs. Shocking experience. Now playing bar doesn't appear, podcasts won't play despite being fine on desktop. Had to uninstall and redownload, lost all my downloaded songs and files. I live in a bad signal area so rely on downloads when not on WiFi. For a market leader it's absolutely ridiculous.
__label__song_selection __label__playlist __label__user_experience Pretty good, like the song selection but now my playlists are buried under other stuff unless I click for only my composed playlists. I do love some of the suggestions made by Spotify.
__label__song_selection I searched for a song, it appeared, but when playing, it's not the song I searched for. 👎👎👎
__label__advert __label__song_selection Very good app for listening ads its been 6 months i am listen to ads but there is some issue sometimes it play songs that ruined my mood of listening ads
__label__song_selection It has all the good music I like.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection Everything is good I really like this app But there's one thing Why isn't song selection available in Nepal ?? Please make sure song selection is available in Nepal too.
__label__user_experience __label__subscription_or_cost __label__song_selection __label__connectivity I really love this app I literally use it everyday and have a subscription however. For some reason it stops playing all the time it will be playing fine for 20 mins then all the sudden it stops playing and when I try to press play it won't so I have to close the app completely and go back just to turn it back on.
__label__song_selection __label__subscription_or_cost __label__advert Wonderful app! You can play music offline even without premium. The only problem is that there are too many ads.
__label__song_selection Great songs from this app.
__label__account __label__subscription_or_cost __label__support I know a lot of apps do this now. But Spotify happens to be the one that did it recently. it's really really annoying to have my phone go off every single day when Spotify failed to get payment.
__label__user_experience __label__connectivity __label__bug Had no problems for so many years on my Android phone but now, I don't know why, my Spotify doesn't launch and is always stuck on a black screen.
__label__podcast __label__bug __label__user_experience __label__song_selection I have been experiencing a sudden stop to what am I listening. Several times in the same podcast for example. Also, lately there is an error and I can't see anymore the buttons. I was listening to a playlist, had the music stopped not by me, and had to go back to the same music manually. Or I didn't had the skip the music even visible on my screen.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience I love it! Would give it 5 stars, but I have to undownload it once and a while because the app wont show the song I am listening too.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__advert __label__playlist Excellent app. Love the music variety to listen to. Not having app issues.👍👍👍 *(edit) this last update is bad, I need to hear 3 adverts before I GET a chance to hear a random song, yeah you heard it right (a random song) because it doesn't let me listen to the one I want, if I am lucky I can listen to that song after 6 skips. It shuffles the songs. Total stars goes down to 2 🌟.*
__label__playlist Good app for music listeners. However, please stop adding other kinds of music in my playlist. It's not a good option...
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__audio_quality __label__support Awesome great for song selection and albums would totally recommend for all ages. Just think it uses too much space. Recently it has connectivity issues or stopping music. But other then that its a great app.
__label__user_experience __label__support __label__bug App is not opening.. I have installed it several times still the issue isn't fixed..
__label__bug __label__user_experience Got some bugs going on. Had to Uninstall cuz the app went into possessed mode.... I was watching a movie when out of no where music started interrupting...
__label__song_selection __label__playlist __label__user_experience __label__connectivity Can't play an individual song, can't choose a specific playlist, won't play songs in order and can't listen offline or in between apps.
__label__bug __label__song_selection __label__playlist App frequently clears my queue with no warning, repeats the same song 10+ times, breaks my playlists
__label__song_selection __label__subscription_or_cost __label__user_experience Love Spotify soo much I love music so that makes sense but I can't afford to have premium so if u want to play whatever song u want without worrying about your skips have Spotify on a tablet or I pad and u can just pick what song u want out of your playlist if that makes sense
__label__audio_quality __label__song_selection Songs clarity superb, good app to hear all journals of music.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__subscription_or_cost Urgent Requirement! ⚠️ You must add the "download music option" in tha application. Although downloads remain close inside the application. But it should me in free mode.
__label__song_selection __label__advert It is cool and good songs are there, no ads and no advisement, the app is excellent.
__label__song_selection Very nice music experience thanku for Spotify
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience I cant even listen to my own songs, last time you can but now you can't, this app sucks
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__subscription_or_cost Absolutely horrible every update it's even harder to get the song you want to play. I installed it just so I don't have to install songs and I don't want to pay just to listen to the song that I want to :(
__label__song_selection The app is super awesome... i got no complains... I'm so so happy... Some songs don't have lyrics i think they have to sort that out but so far so good👍🏾
__label__audio_quality __label__playlist Spotify is really great. I love the sound quality and the way it creates playlists for you is insane. I only listen to Spotify songs and it's so AMAZING!!!
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__advert __label__playlist __label__song_selection Free version is not satisfactory! I don't mind an advertisement every few songs. The free version includes songs to your playlists that you didn't choose. There's no option to skip them. You don't have the ability to play individual songs, it's always in shuffle mode. There's a limit of skipping only 6 songs per hour. Uninstalled.
__label__song_selection Great app for music
__label__song_selection I hate this app because of the additional songs feature when I listen to my songs; unknown tracks pop up and it's irritating.
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__advert More and more if you buy premium and if it's end you more ads.
__label__audio_quality __label__advert The quality is good but the only problem is ads .... It contains a lot of ads please remove the ads.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__account Playing meditation music at night - cuts off after 30 seconds. During the day, can drive 8hrs and not have it cut off. Adjusted all the settings so that it has full background access, no luck. Super disappointed.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience App having nice song collection But the app shows partiality in treating languages. When hearing Hindi songs lyrics comes in Hindi script However while hearing Tamil songs lyrics comes in English script. If Tamil songs lyrics also comes in Tamil script. It will be 😊.
__label__user_experience Amazing app always calms my mood after a long stressful day 😊
__label__user_experience __label__connectivity This app gets really annoying when I try open it it never actually opens properly and it takes me an hour just to open it don't recommend
__label__user_experience __label__bug __label__subscription_or_cost __label__song_selection Used to be a great app. But now if you're a Samsung Galaxy user there is no more visible player. Which means you can't pause, start, stop, skip or go back a track. It also now crashes regularly. I've been a premium user without these issues for years, but now it is hardly worth the subscription. It would be useful if Spotify could rectify these issues enabling the user to have some sort of listener control. Update: it had been fixed but now the same issue is happening again in July 2022.
__label__song_selection __label__advert It's a very nice app, specifically for music but there's only one catch that the ads are so annoying.
__label__advert __label__song_selection Why don't you just play ads instead of songs?
__label__advert __label__song_selection Worst app, if you want to listen ads then listen to Spotify, but if you are interested in songs then please find another app.
__label__song_selection Good music app i like it
__label__user_experience Some time only lag.............
__label__account __label__support __label__bug Why my Spotify error when I want to log out. I have tried to uninstall and install it again but this app can't fix. Please help me to fix the app😭😭😭
__label__connectivity __label__playlist __label__user_experience I'm unable to open app. If I go onto the internet I'm able to view my Playlist however I can't click on the app itself to take me there anymore which is frustrating.
__label__song_selection I enjoy Spotify and have been using it for quite a while. My only gripe with it is that when listening to an artist's mix I wish they played more of the artist and less of similar artists.
__label__song_selection __label__advert __label__user_experience I don't know whether I am using this app for song selection or for listening to adverts! After every 60 seconds of ad, if I change 2-3 songs quickly, it gives the yt shorts ad again within fur seconds. It seems like I would have to uninstall this app, cause its really annoying.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection The new update is not the best it doesn't let u listen to the music u like
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__playlist I mostly enjoy the app. I have over 4000 songs downloaded. Recently the option to shuffle play has disappeared and it plays the same songs over and over. I knew that I can make playlists but again it's the same thing over and over.
__label__comparison __label__song_selection __label__subscription_or_cost The pc spotify version is greater than this version. It doesn't need premium to skip/unshuffle the songs.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__account __label__bug I've been using it for years, but I started having issues with my selected songs during these past weeks. The songs get stuck at 4seconds in and won't load. Even if they are downloaded. I'm now trying to delete and reinstall my account ..
__label__song_selection __label__bug I rate this 1 star bc when I play my favorite song it keeps playing on different song which making me hate this app. Plss fix this
__label__user_experience __label__playlist __label__song_selection __label__connectivity __label__support __label__bug Hi! I have been using Spotify for a while but now I just can't play any playlist or song, it keeps saying something is wrong, my internet and everything is very well working, and this problem annoys me a lot so please fix this, leaving this everything else is fine.
__label__song_selection __label__bug __label__playlist When I try to play a song it always shows" this playlist is empty. Go to Home to find playlists just for you. how to resolve this issue?
__label__user_experience __label__subscription_or_cost __label__bug I can't open this app no matter what, it's stuck literally and the worst thing is I have paid for premium, I have paid and can't use it just because this stupid app just doesn't responds. I have tried restart, reinstall and everything btw this sucks!
It's Spotify. There's nothing bad about it
__label__user_experience __label__advert __label__subscription_or_cost This is a superb app and I have no issues with it except for the frequency of the ads. I am aware that purchasing the premium version removes these ads. However, it can be quite bothersome to have a 30-second ad every half hour. Perhaps, it could be adjusted to every hour or so.
__label__song_selection __label__comparison This app is perfect but i giving 3 stars because the many songs i search was not found by spotify. The soundcloud was the best it have every song when i search. Please add the turkish,arabic and remix lofi it is miss in spotify. Please fix it and add. Thanks
__label__advert __label__song_selection __label__user_experience 3 ads per skip is bothersome when the chance of hearing the song you requested is already a 1/5 gamble unless they like what you request. Sepultura, slayer
__label__user_experience __label__subscription_or_cost __label__advert Still learning to navigate the programming. Guess I have to go to Premium because the commercials are annoying
__label__bug __label__advert __label__user_experience The app crashes all the time. When an ad plays, it crashes. When you switch to another app and come back to Spotify, the app crashes. Always have to restart the app.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__account I can't skip songs now, I got only 6 skips per hour. Like what the hell bro? I just want to listen to music normally, not to wait until song ends. I'm not using this anymore sorry guys.
__label__song_selection __label__advert __label__user_experience __label__subscription_or_cost __label__comparison After every single song it plays an ad and they are heavily annoying even after an update they haven't realized its annoying to keep such thing they removed the feature 30min ad free after a video ad better to see other option.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience It doesn't play the music I like, it doesn't leave my main screen. I just hate it
__label__audio_quality __label__bug It skips when I don't want it to and it messes with the sound and it keeps playing and pausing when I don't want it to..if this is a bug please fix it.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience I like how I can play any songs I want, although it can only be 6 skips.
__label__song_selection I love bts songs sooo much thank for providing this all😇😇
__label__user_experience Would give higher, but lately the app will not even load.
__label__song_selection __label__subscription_or_cost __label__comparison Half the songs are missing! Not what I like to see in a paid service. Amazon music has a better collection of music!
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience Some other songs are not available like BTS song and other things is ok. Please sort out this thing why BTS Songs is not available.
__label__audio_quality It works great but sometimes has some issues of quality audio.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__audio_quality Excellent app....👍 Easy to use..lots of options... enjoying the music so much...
__label__song_selection Great to listen to music
__label__user_experience Best music app i have ever used
__label__advert __label__song_selection __label__user_experience This app is getting worse It's meant to be free and you get 30 minutes without no adverts And I am still getting 6 adverts I can only listen to music for 15 minutes it for 15 minutes then I get more adverts
__label__podcast __label__song_selection __label__account __label__subscription_or_cost I love spotify, I listen to the podcast and I listen to a ton of music, I have over 2,000 songs saved and I have a premium account and have had one for a while, would recommend Spotify to anyone and I do.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection The app has been great however recently when I search a song it plays a totally different song from the one I choose.
__label__song_selection Good music listing app
__label__song_selection __label__bug __label__user_experience __label__subscription_or_cost I used to LOVE the app but now all my selected songs are unavailable and I had to find them again BUT I can't. I tried several times but they just won't load again so I tried looking up other songs and again no luck! I have a subscription so I can't say anything about skipping and stuff but I think that since the last update Spotify is just troublesome. It's lagging all the time, and I can't even listen to music offline because it just won't play. Please fix these issues Spotify!!
__label__song_selection This app is so cool, I can find any song on this. 👍
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__playlist The apps doing really good on my end, although when I exit and play a song when I get back on the song doesn't show on the bottom. I wish we could pin more than 4 playlists on my library. Other than that I still love Spotify<3
__label__connectivity __label__subscription_or_cost __label__user_experience Mine is not connecting with the internet and i just subscribe to premium my App is crashing
__label__user_experience Best App ever created in this world 5 star without any doubt.....if u have a doubt then go duck yourself... thanks...
__label__user_experience Idk what you guys did with the user experience but it feels like i have less control.
__label__song_selection __label__song_selection __label__user_experience Very rare to not find a song I'm looking for.....it happens, but not often. Even obscure music is available, I love that the lyrics are offered with most songs.... I'll never not have Spotify
__label__connectivity __label__bug __label__song_selection __label__playlist This app has major connectivity and bug issues. I use it on android OS12. Firstly, you cannot play a specific song that is shared to you via social media. When you press the green play button to the bottom right of the song title the app simply ignores it and plays whatever it wants from random artists. If you enter your playlist the same thing happens. This is very biased song selection since the specific artists on spotify cannot get there own music played per share. Fix it.
__label__user_experience I Really Love Spotify But app it's not working please fix it
__label__song_selection __label__playlist Whenever I start a radio based off a song or artist (which is with the intention to find a NEW artist or NEW music that is related to the song/artist I'm starting the radio off of) it just creates essentially a playlist of music I've been listening to - and not even within the same genre off the song. I've realized that I haven't found any new artists or any new music, and just continuously listen to the same things over and over again which is quite depressing.
__label__advert __label__song_selection Along with the wrapped for a year, Spotify should also give the count for the number of ads given per year . Other than the too many ads , it is good for listening to music
__label__audio_quality __label__advert __label__user_experience Friends download this app without any doubt .. it's my opinion sarojsk
__label__song_selection __label__subscription_or_cost Plays songs you don't want to play. (yes subscription exists but listening to a song you didn't even click on is crazy)
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__song_selection __label__user_experience This is the best music platform, I admit to that especially when the user subscribes to it. But certain problems I'm not so happy with is that it doesn't refresh and show recently released hits. I'll have to see them in other apps then download them on Spotify or follow the artist. I'll still give it a complete rating, 'cause the updates lately are good. It'd be satisfactory if I hear an artist dropped a track and I see it quickly on the home page. Please work on this. It'd be acknowledged.
__label__song_selection No Auto Artist and Album List. It is should be all about the songs. If I like the song, the artist and album should be generated into an auto list.
__label__song_selection __label__audio_quality __label__bug __label__support __label__comparison I was happy with the app because it holds all the artists I like with very few gaps. Until I bought Bluetooth phones and discovered that it constantly stutters audio playback - the only app to do so. There's a very long discussion thread on the Spotify community going back to April 2017 with a multitude of other users who never found a solution. Some resorted to the competition because the company clearly doesn't care. I'm also considering that.
__label__song_selection __label__playlist __label__user_experience It's a nice app but then when I select a song from a playlist, it plays a suggested song, which I find annoying. I just want to listen to the songs I added in the playlist, not the suggested songs.
__label__account __label__subscription_or_cost __label__song_selection __label__playlist __label__user_experience Upd: watch your language Spotify and don't command me like that: "Update your account NOW!". I won't update anything if I don't want to. I'm tired that I can't remove ONE specific track from my song selection. I block it every day and Spotify continues to add it in my auto generated playlists. It's hard to use the playlist feature in the Android app.
__label__song_selection __label__audio_quality __label__advert I am giving you 2 stars. Songs are definitely cool with good quality but your advertisements are too long. I use YouTube because we can skip in 5 sec but your ads are too long.
__label__connectivity __label__user_experience New phone and the player has to be force quit all the time does not work properly.
__label__user_experience __label__subscription_or_cost __label__song_selection __label__playlist __label__account I've been using this app since it come about and have always had premium and in recent years it's just getting worse an worse, what is the need to redownload the same song every day Spotify?! I hardly pick new songs to go into my playlists and every single day the app is downloading said playlist for offline use. then taking extra long to search or even add to queue, I never complain about apps but this is by far becoming one of the most unreliable apps for music.
__label__song_selection __label__playlist __label__support I can't listen to what I want, why shuffling songs in an album or playlist against my will ? Damn! Pls fix this..
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__podcast Amazing user experience, I'm able to listen to my favorite songs and podcasts. Awesome app
__label__bug It's good till it gets glitches.
__label__song_selection Very good app for streaming music
__label__song_selection __label__bug __label__user_experience Easiest and most convenient way for a student to stream music, but the app can be considerably buggy on my Samsung S8 *edit* Bugs still persist on Samsung S21.
__label__user_experience __label__subscription_or_cost __label__bug __label__support I love Spotify,and use it every day, have a subscription, BUT it's glitchy as heck. It restarts in the middle of stuff, I constantly have to check in on why it's stopped. So last night I deleted & reloaded it. Now it won't work at all.
__label__song_selection They remove all the good songs. Stupidify!
__label__song_selection __label__advert Download Spotify mod apks instead of real apk...we are here to listen to songs not ads.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience I love listening to songs. This app is so perfect. I am from West Bengal and listen to Hindi, English, Bengali, Arabic songs on it.
__label__account __label__user_experience __label__connectivity I dont know what's happening because my Spotify won't log in and not opening as well when I'm using my data. I got an error always!
__label__user_experience The now playing bar has disappeared.
__label__user_experience __label__audio_quality __label__song_selection The app is very easy to use and it sounds great! My problem with it is that it keeps playing suggested songs in all my playlists even though it has over 50 artists and songs in it.
__label__song_selection __label__advert __label__subscription_or_cost Amazing app for songs, It's one of the best I've used of all for music...... there are just too many ads but everything is exceptional and premium was also good.
__label__audio_quality Nice audio quality
__label__song_selection __label__podcast Awesome app with not just music but valuable podcasts.
__label__user_experience __label__playlist __label__advert __label__subscription_or_cost __label__podcast I've used spotify for years, it works without issue, and there's loads of brilliant user submitted playlists to choose from. There is ads every so often but you can go ad free, if you prefer. Unlike youtube you can close the screen with your music or podcast playing in the background, which is why its my music app of choice.
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__account __label__song_selection :) would be cool if everyone gets the premium package so everyone can use the account instead of just for 1 person, and with the discount price of a student. Music is life.
__label__song_selection It is the best song selection platform I have ever seen.
__label__song_selection Love Spotify music.
__label__audio_quality __label__song_selection This app is good... I don't know why there are no older songs like 80-90s songs and famous songs like boys, visvasam,sivaji movies and so on .so pls add some Tamil songs from 2000-2021 and also recent movie songs.
__label__user_experience __label__account __label__bug Hi Spotify devs, I like using Spotify but as of late the user experience has deteriorated. I logged out of my Spotify account and since then the app has become unresponsive; I wouldn't be able to login or access the homepage or anything. The app stays stuck on a screen just showing the Spotify logo. Can someone help me fix this please
__label__song_selection __label__bug this app was really good but the new update ruin the app, I just can play the song that I want for a second. please fix it, thanks.
__label__advert __label__song_selection __label__subscription_or_cost Far too many ads, basic things that should be free such as playing a solitary song you want to listen to. You have to pay for.
__label__bug __label__user_experience __label__connectivity I accidentally delete the Spotify data, yeah that's my fault. But I try to reinstall it and now I just stuck on the logo loading screen.
__label__user_experience I like the app but the shuffle option is disturbing, please remove it.
__label__playlist __label__user_experience Very addictive and super playlist.
__label__song_selection __label__comparison Its an easier way to listen to music! It's honestly better than listening to music on YouTube. I love this!
__label__subscription_or_cost It's awesome it just sucks that u have to pay for it
__label__user_experience __label__advert __label__song_selection __label__subscription_or_cost I love this app but the new update is annoying. I know that's on purpose to make us purchase premium. Giving us ads is enough. Not allowing us to choose or change the music and turning off shuffle for us is irritating. I'll still rate it 4/5 because I've been using this app for years already but I just haven't subscribed to premium.
__label__advert __label__audio_quality Good app. Advertisements too loud... Much too loud. Speaker volume to 50% but advertisements are 80%-90% or louder. Too bad.
__label__user_experience __label__audio_quality __label__subscription_or_cost I've been using for 5 years, it's awesome, it's an app that I use daily, I've been using premium for a long time and I have absolutely no regrets, money well spent.
__label__song_selection It's really ok and impacting but not all needed songs are available on Spotify.
__label__user_experience __label__connectivity Spotify is also a good application when there is internet and not good when it is offline
__label__user_experience __label__bug The pause play bar has gone missing! Please can this be looked at. Perhaps something weird in the last update?
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience Had this since 2014. I just HATE that the shuffle songs repeat. It's shuffled but in the same pattern every time.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection I would have given them a 5 only if they made us able to back up or transfer the downloads
__label__user_experience __label__connectivity __label__song_selection I really liked this application and I advise everyone to download it, but the only problem is when I want to listen to songs without the Internet, I can not, but the application is still very good 😍♥️♥️
__label__user_experience __label__support Cuberstalkers, cyberbullies, narcissistic hackers BFF. The whole guns don't kill people people kill people veil to hide behind. It's a good thing you're not spinach then you can be recalled.
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__account __label__playlist __label__user_experience __label__song_selection Terrible just wants money.... been paying for premium for a year almost and now that I haven't paid, they won't even let me in the app to select what Playlist I'm listening to, just give me 2 options 1) pay them or 2) cancel which I don't want to do as my dad is in charge of our duo account. Terrible streaming service!!!
__label__user_experience I love this app so much. I have a great user experience with it.
__label__song_selection __label__account Basic features such as playing things in order are unavailable without paying.
__label__song_selection Wonderful! Keeps me upbeat when I need it
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__account After getting the premium my life began to ease up a bit and I thank Spotify 🙏🏾
__label__user_experience It is very good app but its new update is very, very bad I am deleting this app.
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__account Was fantastic, having been a premium user for over three years. The recent revision hinders Spotify from displaying the current song, therefore skipping is not possible. It will randomly halt, necessitating manual phone reopening. Despite uninstalling and reinstalling, the issue persists.
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__account __label__user_experience I wish I had premium but otherwise great experience
__label__comparison __label__account So it's great but I sort of miss my previous music app. Spotify is awesome; however it's not like I've ever been to Vietnam. I got phished! Be careful.
__label__song_selection __label__connectivity __label__account __label__user_experience Very irritating. I want to stream music over mobile data and says no internet connection seriously....... Furthermore i am a premium user but still suffer. Please check on that as soon as you can.
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__podcast __label__advert __label__account __label__audio_quality __label__bug Spotify is regarded as a less satisfactory platform for listening to podcasts. It incorporates advertisements that are not provided by the podcast creators, making the podcasts sound uneven. A premium subscription doesn't rectify this issue. Furthermore, some podcast episodes seem to be missing random 20-second audio segments, a problem that does not occur on other platforms, suggesting a flaw on Spotify's side. The missing audio is likely a bug linked to the ads that Spotify includes in the episodes.
__label__audio_quality __label__user_experience The app sound is amazing, I've been using it for some time.
__label__song_selection Spotify are the best, any music you have all thanks.
__label__song_selection Best app to listen to your favourite music anytime, anywhere.
__label__song_selection Why don't you guys add a feature for every song. Like a karaoke. Since you already have lyrics on some songs.
__label__song_selection __label__audio_quality __label__user_experience Auto play random songs. It is non sense frustrating. I have set auto play off and it still skip and plays random stuff. Utter garbage. Good quality in song is not answer to the random song recommendation.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience Now this app is very, very bad. I don't like it because any song I try to play, doesn't play.
__label__audio_quality __label__advert __label__song_selection __label__connectivity July 6th, 2022. Just came back to Spotify today around 03:37, I'm not amused on how the Audio Devices I'm using currently onto Bluetooth and AUX Cable too, I used to have a quite different experience than a lower mono-audio about now. By the way; the sound was needed to be up around 94% oye. Ad's are fine but gives you 30 minutes of listing to music; But other devices that I use this app isn't the same, I only use shuffle mode.
__label__advert Too much advertisement .. too much disturbing ...
__label__song_selection Awesome reference to my favorite songs
__label__song_selection Full with Entertainment
__label__song_selection Its good and choice in your hands.....
__label__song_selection __label__playlist App shuffles my Playlist and took all my skips and plays songs that aren't even on my Playlist
__label__user_experience __label__advert This app isn't functioning well on my tablet, only the Spotify logo shows. Also, continuous advertisements promoting Spotify downloads for parties, which I find misleading and frustrating.
__label__song_selection You should try to suggest some new and hits songs. And also make some other list for hit songs.
__label__audio_quality Super audio quality
__label__user_experience Spotify is wow I love it and I will recommend people to use it
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__advert Best ever music app I ever experienced is Spotify. Never witnessed any song unavailable and that's the best thing about it. But still , in offline music(without premium) ,it include lot of ads which can be considered as "excess".
__label__song_selection __label__podcast I love this app so much I love the music and everything about it. The podcasts I really enjoy, it's really interesting.
__label__user_experience __label__advert __label__song_selection Worst app ever. They give songs between ads, I mean how can they even put songs between the ads , it just ruins the joyful experience of listening to the ads. If they remove the songs I will definitely give them 5 stars.
__label__song_selection __label__audio_quality Amazing experience! All the songs and albums, whether local or international, for last 30 years I've been enjoying...are now at my fingertips at the highest quality...thanks to Spotify.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience This gives me the ability to play any genre of music I choose and I can literally DJ on the go , love it
__label__user_experience Great app, use it every day
__label__song_selection __label__audio_quality __label__bug __label__user_experience __label__account The problem is just becoming more unstable. I used to use this app and another one simultaneously in the past, it used to work better, but now it stops on one song only. I don't know why it stops. I updated the version again but the problem persisted. Furthermore, when I search for some songs, the system states something went wrong, no internet connection, etc. If this continues, I will not opt for any premium account anymore.
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__advert __label__account Just got a full screen ad for sponsored content on premium. That's not how you do to paying customers.
__label__song_selection __label__advert Every time ads after one song, worst app.
__label__song_selection Great music app. God bless you all. Christ Jesus loves you.
__label__song_selection I love this app for selecting songs.
__label__podcast __label__bug I love to listen to my podcasts while driving is during my train commute, but the recent update constantly interrupts playback, so I'll uninstall for now. It's a brilliant app otherwise.
__label__user_experience Mind blowing app so easy to use and it's amazing 😉❤️
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__podcast __label__account __label__comparison __label__song_selection The only place where I can get both music and podcasts. Great! I would not live without it. The only reason I do not have premium anymore is that I have got another music streaming service through my phone subscription - if I had not, I would definitely still subscribe to Spotify. Edit: have you considered adding ratings to your podcasts/songs? That would be nice.
__label__song_selection __label__bug All those months it not work and they have not fix this issue if I play a song it will randomly play a random song please fix this again and the next update ok manager and developer 😤
__label__user_experience __label__audio_quality __label__connectivity I have installed in my android tv but whenever i play it the tv hangs and there is no problem with the apps even though i update the spotify on time
__label__song_selection Very good as I have found everything I have looked for
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__account This app is trash, needs premium to anything 😤🙄, Can't listen to Any songs I like, always bringing me to Another song, I'm already giving credit on Streaming An Artist and you can't even let me do that!!! 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
__label__account __label__connectivity __label__playlist __label__song_selection __label__user_experience I really enjoy spotify premium and have so for the last few years as a subscriber. After recently updating my phone, my spotify no longer plays anything. All my saved data is gone. The titles and playlists are there but nothing plays. It keeps saying no internet connection try again. I have followed all the user experience suggestions as well. I only just resubscribed 3 weeks ago 😞
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection This is truly the best music app I've ever used and I've tried a lot of them. I love my music and this app has all the music. From the golden oldies to the latest.
__label__user_experience __label__audio_quality __label__bug It's been glitchy lately and music skips like a scratched CD. And today, when I tried opening the app, it stayed at the logo and wouldn't load. I tried uninstalling and installing again, restarting my phone doesn't work either.
__label__audio_quality __label__connectivity Somehow varying streaming quality, maybe due to connection ...
__label__account __label__song_selection The only good thing is that you can share on Instagram stories with pretty lyrics, and that's it.
__label__bug Crashing and closing all the time
__label__advert Too much ads 🥲🥲🥲
__label__user_experience __label__audio_quality __label__song_selection __label__connectivity Been going downhill for years (the user experience to find anything is terrible, audio quality is average and when you select something it favourites it?!) but the way it struggles without a connectivity is infuriating, it just shows a loading screen all the time, even for playlists I've selected. I've selected them because I'm travelling and I know my connection is going to be bad so why am I staring at a loading screen.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience It's good but Why can I not play the song I want to play. It always plays a different song than I'm picking. And 6 skips per hour? That's maddening.
__label__song_selection __label__playlist __label__user_experience __label__advert Well I gave it a four star rating because when I play a song it just keeps on playing the song in my playlist and I can remove the song when I fully exit the app,so it's pretty annoying. Other than that,I really like everything else just besides the annoying part.so it's a pretty good app to me
__label__song_selection Never a boring moment with Spotify, search it you will find it😊
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__bug I've been using this app for years but recently there seems to be a problem with it. Sometimes the music just begins to play and there is no way to stop it. I also can't get the song I'm listening to display its album cover. These issues are recent. Please fix them.
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__account __label__advert __label__song_selection __label__account they were unexceptionally smart to give me spotify premium free for 3 months... after that 3 months i couldn't bear with the ads and i literally became a premium member for good. its the best music streaming app but fyou for taking my money by playing mind games. jk just buy premium duo with a friend, its affordable.
__label__user_experience Can't open the app anymore
__label__song_selection Very interesting app for music lovers
__label__user_experience __label__bug Great! Only problem is that sometimes it can glitch out a bit but it doesn't do that often.
__label__song_selection Fantastic music from top stars always available.
__label__podcast __label__user_experience __label__bug __label__account Recently the app has been randomly losing the player. Can't close the app, can't stop what's playing. Argh! Been using the app for years and have loved it. This needs to be fixed - please! Update July 5, 2022 Seemed to have returned to normal until today - same issue. Am un-installing and re-installing.
__label__advert Awesome app 👌 no adverts
__label__song_selection Best choice for listening to music
__label__advert __label__song_selection What does it mean when you promise 30 minutes of uninterrupted music, but after one song you advertise again? It would be better if you didn't claim to offer 30 minutes of uninterrupted music.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience It would be nice if we can download music and listen offline.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__playlist The mobile version is absolute thrash I can't even choose the song to play, i can only choose a playlist full of songs that I don't like.
__label__playlist This app is great. It has all of my favorite music in one playlist!!! 🕺
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__playlist __label__user_experience __label__account __label__advert The shuffle button isn't on all Playlist. Music stops after 10 secs even after going into the app. Also, I thought if I had the premium duo plan then it would get rid of ads. Why do ads still come up on podcast?? UPDATE: we are now in a July and it's still happening.. remind me why I pay for this account???? First review was from back in April 2022. Maybe if the music wouldn't keep stopping randomly it would make more sense.
__label__bug __label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__account What is going on with all the bugs? Spotify has always been wonderful until the last few months. Bugs, skips, doesn't display what I'm currently listening to, so I can't pause or stop the song without having to close the app. I'm really hoping this gets fixed and I don't have to cancel my subscription ☹️
__label__advert __label__song_selection It says ad free music ad free music only in between ads 💥🔪🔪🔪😭
__label__song_selection __label__connectivity __label__user_experience __label__user_experience __label__bug I play music on my pc. And set pc playback on mobile too. It still doesn't change songs on pc. Lags a lot. Makes it annoying. Please fix it.
__label__song_selection Extensive collection with great recommendations!
__label__user_experience Best free streaming app
__label__user_experience All I know now is Spotify ✨🤧
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__bug In general the app is good, but recently when I play music it will occasionally not show the notification to show what song is playing or the app will freeze, I also can't unhide songs. Please fix these issues.
__label__song_selection __label__bug unusable, songs will not even play and the app crashes constantly
__label__song_selection Very nice app to listen to your favorite songs.
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__user_experience __label__playlist __label__advert __label__comparison __label__account Spotify is great except two things. #1, It would enhance the user experience if it notified you when people interacted with your account. I'm interacting with many friends who are oblivious. It has room for improvement. And #2, if you don't subscribe, you lose the ability to listen to your playlists, unlike YouTube Music that still allows you to enjoy your playlists without a subscription, the only difference is the presence of ads. I dislike that Spotify restricts you in this manner.
__label__user_experience App works great. Many features.
__label__playlist __label__song_selection Now playlist only can be played, but didn't show the list so I can't skip any song I want to hear. Sometimes I want to hear song I like in the playlist multiple times.
__label__playlist __label__user_experience I love spotify. I can create my own playlists, and just listen for hours.
__label__user_experience __label__account Had Spotify for around 10 years planning on going another 10.
__label__user_experience __label__audio_quality __label__song_selection __label__advert It's a good app, good music, but the new update is not up to the mark. The mechanism to shuffle liked songs to listen to music is inconvenient. The inability to tap on the song to hear it fully, but rather hearing only a sample is surprisingly illogical. However, the basic purpose, which is playing music, is fulfilled. The adverts also seem to intrude, making it appear as though there's malware on the phone with random pop-ups.
__label__song_selection Great choices of music and seem to be for Free Speech so you get 5* from me boo
__label__playlist __label__user_experience Stopps playing playlists after just a few minutes
__label__advert __label__account __label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__bug I am fine without needing to pay for music so I get adverts but I dislike everything else. There should be no payment to see what songs are in a playlist. Selected songs should be optional and skips do not reset at all. I have not opened Spotify in 5 days so how do I have no skips. They have fixed all this so yeah, use Spotify.
__label__playlist __label__song_selection __label__connectivity Love it, this app is great for creating playlists and finding the music you love. I also Love the ability to download playlists for when you have no internet.
__label__user_experience New UI with the play button in the left most just feels weird, please fix it to the standard button layout.
__label__song_selection __label__comparison Its better to pirate musics than using this... no youtube is better.
__label__user_experience __label__account In first time, this app is dissatisfied for me. I try to create an account but always reply to me something wrong. Free Log in, Log in with Facebook, Log in with Google account like that show me but can't sign in. What a useless app.
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__account __label__advert The app is great don't get me wrong the only problem is the only way to enjoy it is that you have to pay a to repeat the music you have to pay. it does give you a free trial Without entering any credit card info. but I just don't like that I have to spend money to To do anything great in the app And it also doesn't tell you when the subscription is up. but l can just go on another app and listen to it completely free and offline without paying A single penny.
__label__bug I'm stuck at loading screen.
__label__song_selection __label__comparison I have never been happier with a music provider. i Tuned out after 10 years and literally thousands of dollars. It will take me the rest of my life of ALL available music to make up for it.
__label__bug it literally is stuck on the logo and wont let me play my songs, go to home page or anywhere its just stuck at the logo.
__label__song_selection This is a great app for song selection.
__label__account __label__song_selection __label__user_experience Used to like it but now you have to pay for basic features. You are forced to listen to random songs even if you're trying to listen to one song. It's annoying.
__label__comparison The computer version is way better
__label__comparison In my opinion, Spotify beats all of the music apps out there hands down.
__label__user_experience __label__comparison __label__connectivity __label__account Removed features being used by the client base without any notice. Rather go to YouTube music than continue paying Spotify money. Bring back Spotify connect function and I'll take my review back.
__label__advert __label__song_selection __label__playlist The Reason for less stars is the ads are becoming irritating. This app had uninterruptible playback for approximately 30 minutes if an ad was displayed in between. Now, there are adverts after nearly every song. The app used to have a feature that allowed users to preview a song for approximately 10 seconds before adding it to a playlist. This feature no longer works. Please restore it. Also, please let us re-arrange our playlist.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience I don't know if it's just me but every time I play my liked songs it will play but later it will play a song that I never liked or was interested in.
__label__song_selection This app is soo goodd i can listen to fav songs, and im not gonna find or download it in google or anything, i can just find it in spotify🤍🧡🔥
__label__song_selection Very good I like all music is nice
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience It's a good app BUT how can I not pick the songs I want to play and only get 6 SKIPS AN HOUR it's so annoying why can't I pick my own songs. So after 6 skips, you're stuck listening to songs I don't want to listen to at the moment, why can't I pick the song like on every other device.
__label__advert Too much ads 😔😔😔
__label__advert Love you all except when the ads come in, then I just want to react. 💛
__label__song_selection I would give this 5 stars but the fact that you can't select your desired songs is not ideal.
__label__song_selection Best music app out. Would recommend buying NYSE: SPOT
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection My Spotify app is showing a ton of music from others countries. I need American music. How do I fix that?
__label__song_selection __label__advert Please focus on music not add
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__account I want to download songs to my library on my account. Please advise how to do this.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience I have to say this is a great way to listen and enjoy your music 😁😁
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection Easy to use and add songs
__label__song_selection u love spotify because Jungkook, V and BTS' songs is there.
__label__audio_quality Good for streaming! 👏
__label__advert __label__song_selection __label__user_experience Ads are good because they introduce new songs which are enjoyable, but sometimes it's not good because it interrupts listening to your favorite song.
__label__song_selection __label__playlist __label__advert __label__user_experience Good app, however, every time i want to add a specific song to my playlist, it shows me recommend songs rather than the song i want to look at and add. Edit: now, when ever i try to look at a new song or playlist, it gives me infinite adds. Worst user experience ever. Uninstall and move to YouTube people.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience I pick a song it will change into random music
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__advert __label__account Too much ads. Don't tell me to switch to premium. Don't have a card for it.
__label__user_experience __label__account Great app when it works. I've tried multiple times to get it to stop playing in the background to no avail. Next option is to just delete it and cancel subscription.
__label__user_experience __label__account __label__bug __label__song_selection App is not satisfactory and has been for years. I pay for the service and am plagued by issues and random stoppages. Notifications for playback will break for no reason. Downloads will corrupt and leave you with no song selection for offline mode.
__label__song_selection Spotify is the best app for listening music it has all the features I have never seen before 😄😄✌️
__label__user_experience __label__playlist __label__song_selection I like this app but I dislike the limitation of six skips per hour, and when there is a song I did not add in my playlist. I really hope that changes but overall is still good.
__label__podcast __label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__bug Since June I've been having lots of problems with my podcasts and song selection suddenly I'm playing and It stops and I can't press stop the songs, this is really inconvenient, please try to fix this ASAP this is really annoying.
__label__song_selection __label__bug __label__song_selection __label__playlist It's a good app but there are few things bad with it it has a 6 hour wait to it when u skip like 4. Or 3 songs #2 it skips randomly for no reason #3 u can pick ur own song u just have to hope it's the first one Here is a good thing u can actually change the song without it being random in daily mixes
__label__account __label__user_experience All good. I've been with them for years. One time couldn't manage my account on time. And they handled it for 2 months. Do I half to say anymore. Thank u. . J bird.
__label__advert __label__song_selection __label__user_experience Way too many ads. Plays 1 or 2 songs and then multiple ads then does it again. Very annoying when trying to listen to music.
__label__song_selection __label__account I haven't been able to enjoy music on any other app like I am this one (Spotify) and creating an account is completely Free!
__label__song_selection Very good app. I listen to lots of music on here.
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__song_selection __label__account __label__user_experience __label__advert Ok this app is good but please remove limited skips I have the subscription for it and I love it but the free version is just so bad so make it so you have unlimited skips the ads are fine but the limited skips are just bad so please remove that
__label__advert Worst app, seems more like an ad hub.
__label__advert Make the ads a little shorter and its all good
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience I can't play the music that I want to listen the whole albums starts playing.. please fix that thing up
__label__user_experience Dear spotify, your app is great. But my eyes bleed when I see the background color of lyrics on the desktop version. Please change it to a softer color.
__label__account __label__connectivity __label__song_selection I thought Deezer was bad but Spotify I can't even login, keeps saying you're offline when I'm definitely online. I can't be stressing my brains just to access music, I'm out
__label__advert Would be great but the 5 30 second ads kinda ruin it
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__audio_quality __label__connectivity __label__account __label__comparison What the heck is going on with this app? It was great and now it skips and when I open the app to turn off what I'm listening to, the player at the bottom has disappeared and I can't turn it off without closing the app. Restarting the phone and the app only helps temporarily. Reinstalling the app only works temporarily. I have loved Spotify but am considering switching to Amazon Music because of this nonsense.
__label__song_selection This app is the best way to enjoy songs.
__label__song_selection __label__account __label__user_experience __label__audio_quality __label__bug Great app I've been using it for years and have paid for my subscription. For the last few days there is no way to stop, skip or fast forward the songs. I have to close the entire window to get music to stop playing. Please fix.
__label__user_experience __label__bug __label__connectivity Spotify app on PC is great, you can't doubt that. Although the moment you just wanna travel with music on a phone its so horrible, theres this bug possibly where you're locked on shuffle mode. You can't even have fun with music anymore because Spotify does everything possible to make it unfun.
__label__playlist __label__song_selection It's a good music app but I don't understand why I just cannot continue to skip freely from one song to another. Why restrict the number of times one can skip songs while listening to a playlist.
__label__song_selection __label__bug Suddenly if u put songs in shuffle..the first song plays again and again Please do check this
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__audio_quality __label__account __label__user_experience __label__song_selection The quality of music got worse when i got premium the transitions between songs slowed down and wouldn't load as fast.
__label__song_selection __label__playlist __label__user_experience __label__connectivity two days ago all songs from playlists I listened to were showed in the history of songs I listened to recently as just songs, i.e., there weren’t any playlists and then songs from them, just songs. It confuses the song selection process now, nothing has changed yet. I need answers, I have no idea what’s happening, and it extremely complicates using this app. upd: why can’t I download music lol? what now? nothing changed either.
__label__user_experience __label__advert Great app! One problem! Stop politicizing the ads! I download it to listen to music not hear about LGBTQ or abortion or vaccines.
__label__user_experience Can't open the app anymore. What the heck is going on?
__label__song_selection Great song selection
__label__user_experience __label__account Been listening to Spotify for years. Never have been asked to rate it. Got a new phone and it wants to know what I think. If I didn't like it, I'd be using another platform.
__label__user_experience __label__comparison __label__playlist __label__advert __label__song_selection It's a wonderful platform for enjoying music, and I definitely recommend it. One issue I have, however, is the discrepancy between the different platforms. On the computer, the app offers almost everything you would want besides "no adverts". On the tablet, the user experience is much like the pc version but altered due to it being a different device. However, the phone version needs serious improvements. The adverts are understandable yet restrictive. Additionally, not being able to select individual songs and being limited to only six skips an hour? These limitations need to be reconsidered, particularly for users who may not have access to a tablet or PC. This appears to be unfairly imbalanced.
__label__user_experience __label__bug The recent update has rendered this the most annoying app on my phone. Constantly losing the playing bar. Used to work without issues. Huawei p30 Pro
__label__user_experience __label__account I've been using this for a while and figured they deserved of this rating. I've been using this and I've never had no problems with it. It's a little expensive but worth it.
__label__account Nvm, free spotify sucks
__label__user_experience __label__bug Wow... I moved from ios to Android and the lack of care for Android is astonishing. I'm a software engineer and I would have been fired months ago if I released something this buggy and didn't even bother to fix it. This is not acceptable. It's not that it's buggy, it's that there is no care to fix it. Each new release makes the app more and more unstable. Probably priority is ios and Android just gets the crumbs.
__label__user_experience __label__playlist __label__song_selection Best music streaming service I have ever used. UI is simple and sophisticated. Spotify also features many personalization options that makes the app feel like it was built for you.
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__song_selection __label__playlist __label__account I really don't care about the random pauses in the music. What upsets me is that after 14 days, everything is on shuffle. Like, you cannot pick a certain song on a playlist. Basically, it is forcing you to buy premium or else you will always be annoyed.
__label__audio_quality __label__account The best ever music app after Google play store, with great quality sound n other effects. Specially the premium plan is so worth it. 👍😉😇
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection Nice listening to wonderful music!
__label__podcast __label__advert __label__song_selection Don't use this app, don't give your money to Spotify. Switch to podcasts and actually support artists and not be force fed platform exclusives daily or be bombarded with ads in your listening. Latest update appears to have completely borked the song selection, frequently goes over songs that were playing only minutes before.
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__playlist __label__account __label__comparison Spotify is very greedy, as in the free plan it puts shuffle on and it can't be turned off at all, and so many other things like that are added so you have to get premium. Not worth it, get Pandora.
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__song_selection __label__playlist __label__account __label__user_experience Can't listen to music, playlists for ALL are showing empty. Tried Uninstalling, clearing cache, rebooting...nothing has helped. I have a paid subscription and can't use the service. Update: Customer support was quick to address the issue and offered an easy solution to the problem. Thank you.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__advert Well, what does this app offer that needs rating? It collects and plays the songs of others well. Displays the playlists of others well. Its user experience is straight bad and mostly pushing things I will never and have never clicked on. They should have a "simple" mode that gets rid of all the unnecessary distractions and lets you just listen to music. After all, it doesn't pay its artists, so why does it need to advertise? I already pay for it!
__label__playlist __label__account __label__advert This is a good app. However, I don't appreciate the restrictions on song skipping and the number of adverts I have to endure.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__bug It was nice and I loved to listen to music to drown out the noises or to draw but one day I was off to listen to music but it didn't let me choose music and I thought it was a glitch so I uninstalled the app then reinstalled it back but it still happened. Please put it to that we can choose the song and not randomize it.
__label__playlist __label__song_selection __label__user_experience Why won't my Playlist restart? I keep starting my Podcast so I can draw stuff but then it'll start in the middle of a song and it'll completely throw off the mood, Why won't it restart the playlist instead of picking some random song to start in and then play that song and not let me to skip.
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__user_experience __label__bug I pay for my account and the same day it quits working. Tried uninstalling, clearing data, clearing cache, restarting etc. Can't get past initial logo screen. So who's returning my money to my account?
__label__song_selection __label__account It has a lot of songs of any genre, and if you upgrade to a paid account, it just improves the experience, 10/10 recommended.
__label__connectivity The February update broke Spotify connect to my car's Bluetooth radio is no longer able to connect to Spotify
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__connectivity I can't play any song that I pick, randomly cuts halfway through a song and 6 skips an hour shouldn't be a feature, I have no trouble with this on a console, like PlayStation but this is just generally unusable.
__label__song_selection __label__playlist __label__user_experience Spotify doesn't allow you to listen to the songs you've chosen on your playlist and insists on shuffling songs that you aren't familiar with or don't wish to play. The Spotify experience has become unsatisfactory, hence the one-star rating.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__connectivity __label__bug WHAT HAPPEN TO THE CANVAS? I can't skip to next songs (both on phone and Bluetooth), cannot select loop, random, or direct, can't see the lyrics, and can't skip through songs. PLEASE FIX THIS
__label__connectivity __label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__bug I am begging you, improve the offline functionality. Songs that are supposed to be downloaded won't play, the menus are buggy as hell offline and half the time will just not load, sometimes I can't even pull up my song selection.
__label__user_experience __label__playlist I did love using Spotify! Not anymore since I'm ANNOYED that ALL of my playlists are gone for some reason...
__label__user_experience I really like it. Easy to use and customize.
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__song_selection __label__advert __label__account __label__user_experience Great app, always has up to date music and I can generally always find the songs I'm looking for. I hate ad's so it's definitely worth the monthly subscription. I love listening to music while commuting and Spotify helps make the journey less boring.
__label__bug __label__user_experience __label__connectivity __label__support a new update and same issue as below. last time I had to contact support to fix it. used to love it. a few weeks ago after an update, I stopped seeing a notification in my pull down menu. The app is also switching to playing on the phone after I turned the car off post Bluetooth. Neither of these were ever an issue, I changed nothing about my phone setup.
__label__user_experience __label__account __label__account Right now as soon as I start vacation it is not working, not loading. I've uninstalled, reinstalled, forced stopped, restarted my phone. This is beyond annoying!!! Edit, got a new phone and app still not working!!! Everyone else in my family plan has a working Spotify except myself and I am the plan account holder.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection Spotify doesn't even let me listen to my own song. It keeps playing other songs that I don't like :))
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience Great music, all the songs I grew up with at the push of a button.
__label__user_experience We love our Spotify!
__label__audio_quality __label__user_experience Excellent performance with great hearing experience... The sound system is top-notch.
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__advert __label__account I love Spotify so much but I have two reasons why I don't like it. 1) I hate the ads. 2) premium is good but expensive and it made me broke
__label__podcast __label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__audio_quality __label__connectivity __label__advert The only reason I returned to this God awful app is to watch jre. Although I haven't been able to in over a year because their mobile app is so poorly made I'll end up waiting five minutes for something to load just for it to buffer every twenty seconds without fail. Beyond frustrating to use even without the ads. I couldn't recommend this app any less and I personally believe an honest to God 8-track would be an improvement to whatever the hell Spotify claims to be.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection Easy to use and very popular so it has a wide selection of music.
__label__account __label__playlist Everything related to accounts incurs costs. And the random song selection being added to your playlist is annoying.
__label__bug __label__song_selection __label__user_experience Fix the app! Keeps crushing, plays what ever it wants, doesn't react, if I want to switch it off I need to close it from the background.
__label__audio_quality The sound quality is exceptional.
__label__comparison __label__account How come when we use Spotify on computer we can loop for free but when we use it on phone we have to pay. That's just illogical.
__label__song_selection Good music I can find even old music.
__label__user_experience __label__connectivity __label__comparison Whenever I open the app and numerous times while using it I get a message that I should turn on Bluetooth. I know Bluetooth is off. I turned it off. There are no Bluetooth devices where I am. It has become so annoying that I am looking for an alternative.
__label__song_selection __label__playlist Spotify is great for song selection. And it's cool to be able to create playlists.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__playlist Spotify gives you access to a lot of music, but often fails at functionally working. It doesn't have all the albums I want but has an interesting way of recommending new music.
__label__user_experience __label__bug __label__song_selection __label__audio_quality __label__comparison Spotify is the best music app for me. I thoroughly enjoy the overall design! Although there are some bugs, they didn't hinder me much from having a good experience. I hope for more song additions and an improved audio quality, much like AM (the current quality is good but an enhancement wouldn't hurt)
__label__user_experience My app won't even open... I have tried reinstalling it and it still won't work..
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience Good but can be a bit confusing and difficult. Sometimes you search and play your particular song and it pops up a totally different one. Spotify should really work on that.
__label__account The app will not open to the log in page
__label__song_selection __label__bug Spotify needs to be fixed. I have the explicit content toggle on, yet I can't play the songs. Please rectify this issue.
__label__song_selection __label__audio_quality __label__comparison You can't always view video or track at what point in the audio the song is. Why? This is a problem that Amazon and YouTube do not encounter.
__label__user_experience __label__account __label__bug Spotify was great until all of a sudden I logged out for 1 quick second and now I can't load into the app and I'm stuck in the loading screen with the logo for the past 3 days, it'd be 5 stars if this was fixed.
__label__user_experience __label__bug __label__account __label__song_selection Spotify has recently been giving me issues where it simply won't load past the logo screen. This enduring loading time, lasting for hours, is disruptive to my streaming sessions. Even measures like uninstalling and reinstalling the app, restarting my phone, and clearing both data and cache have not resolved the issue. This is creating a frustrating user experience. This problem needs to be addressed.
__label__song_selection __label__advert __label__user_experience Spotify was best in the beginning, you could play any song you like and I believe it was ad-free. However, like one month after download when I click a song it doesn't even play the song I chose. I don't know if this happens with other people on mobile, however it is very annoying to click a song only to hear something else.
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__account __label__advert __label__song_selection Free spotify tends to get more insidious the more you use it to frustrate you into paying for premium, to the point that it would play 2 songs then 3 ads repeatedly.
__label__comparison __label__playlist __label__user_experience After comparing over five(5) music apps, this ranks high in my favorites. Its sharing feature enhances my interaction with family and friends. The playlist creation option is also a hit, allowing for personalized experiences. It's my top choice.
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__song_selection __label__playlist __label__account It doesn't let you select the music you want to listen to, once you select a playlist it goes on shuffle and you can't change that unless you buy premium.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience The last time I tuned in, it kept flicking from one song to another, and wouldn't let me listen to the song that I wanted to.
__label__song_selection __label__podcast __label__user_experience __label__account It just stops playing music and podcast it will work for a song or two or 10 minutes into a podcast then it just stops, play bar is going like you just started the app up, doesn't remember that played a song or where it stopped in song or podcast. Then you have to go back in the app find where you stopped hearing the content. Got full bars, 5G unlimited plan no where near the ramp down limit so it's not that. Pandora and utube music play just fine. Starting to wonder why I pay for this when it
__label__advert It's nice, but there are too many adverts.
__label__user_experience __label__account __label__bug My spotify has been working fine for 5 years. i cleared the app data to clear some space on my phone. Now when I click onto the app, it doesn't go past the green logo which I'm stuck on. Can't get to the login screen or anything. PLEASE FIX THIS spotify is my lifeeeeeee
__label__podcast __label__user_experience __label__bug __label__podcast __label__account The primary reason I use the service is to access exclusive podcasts such as JRE. Although I value Spotify as a company, frequent app crashes diminish the experience. On frequent occasions, when I attempt to play a podcast, the features fail to load which also omit any video content, which eliminates the possibility to fast-forward or rewind within the podcast. It's almost as if the app does not recognize its current performance state. If the app were more reliable, I might be encouraged to use it for music streaming and potentially upgrade to a premium account, but the current issues make it too frustrating.
__label__user_experience __label__advert __label__song_selection __label__account Sptify is a nice app . but it doesn't let us enjoy the music. Ads every second and only 5 skips a day! its forcing the user to pay. and that's lame .please let some freedom for the users so they don't hate this app.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection Easy to use and provides great suggestions!
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection Found the app easy to use and your options are limitless
__label__user_experience Last update won't let the app open!!!!
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection My music the way I want it, where I want it... when I want it. Love the Spotify App!
__label__song_selection Thumbnail is other artists and songs item list of another artist
__label__account __label__song_selection The stupidest app really. You take premium for a week and you can download only 30 songs?! Disgusting. Never spending one more penny on this useless app.
__label__user_experience __label__playlist __label__song_selection I love spotify and use is all the time,but the only thing that I don't like about spotify is that it doesn't play all of the songs on the playlist before it repeats some of the songs. But other than that I would definitely recommend it.
__label__song_selection __label__podcast I love spotify. It not only has music I like it also has podcasts that fit my interests. And I don't mean sport or anime podcast even though I haven't looked. I'm talking crime, supernatural, or scary type podcasts.
__label__podcast __label__user_experience Trash app wouldn't even use if it hadn't moved over. Literally randomly just changed podcasts and pauses for no reason all the time.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__playlist I've been using this app for 4 years, but the new update is getting on my nerves. If you want to listen to a song you can't listen to it first if you even wanted to, instead, it puts the songs in a order where you can't choose which one you want to listen to first. Not only that, but when I tap on a song to listen to it instead of showing the play button it shows other songs and not the one I wanted to listen to. It is also frustrating when I want to play a song on my playlist.
__label__user_experience __label__connectivity No issue and encountered ever since I installed this app super user-friendly and was to link to my car and BT speaker.
__label__connectivity __label__user_experience __label__song_selection Constantly stopping, regularly not showing playback options and offline mode is spotty at best.
__label__playlist __label__song_selection Why the hell can't I play my playlist, do I need to shuffle it? Stop trying to give me songs that are like the songs in my playlist. Just let me listen to my damn songs, it's annoying.
__label__user_experience __label__comparison The app has horrendous lag on my Note 10+ yet works fine on my brother's phone, I am fully updated to the newest version I can, and the issue persists. There is something deeply wrong with this app, and it needs to be figured out soon.
__label__song_selection __label__advert __label__user_experience __label__playlist __label__account Many problems with this app. #1 You can’t even play the songs you want. Every time I shuffle play liked songs or my own playlists it just plays songs that aren’t even there. #2 Too much ads. #3 Whenever I search for a song, I have to go through every single playlist that appeared till I find the one I want, sometimes I don’t even find it. #4 You have 6 skips every hour but can’t even play what you want so I just skip to the song I want but then my skips are just wasted. You need to fix this.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience Really knows how to setup the music, great system 👍
__label__song_selection __label__advert __label__user_experience __label__account The app has such a variety of music and introduces new artists so you don't get bored of your favorite artist, however despite the apps quality, the ad situation is a little obnoxious. Having to pay a fair price for ad-free and offline music is a fair deal, still ads should depend on the age of your account, so the longer you have your account, the less ads you get.
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__playlist __label__account __label__song_selection __label__user_experience This app is so annoying....after the last update all playlist has under go on shuffle mood and you can't disable it without buying a premium...... and you can't change song over 6 times..... this is so disappointing..... I am going to uninstall this app.
__label__user_experience __label__bug Sometimes it's laggy for me. Crashes often too...(　；∀；)...
__label__song_selection __label__playlist __label__user_experience __label__account __label__comparison Since mid May 2022, I can't play anything on Spotify. All of my playlists are either empty or have like 2 songs on them. Even official Spotify playlists are empty. Edited: There's been 4 updates since this post and I still can't listen to any music. I pay for this and I can't use it. The website works but I can't download a playlist there so I have to use my mobile data. I'll be switching to Pandora, I guess. I prefer Spotify but I can't use it! 😡
__label__connectivity __label__user_experience Keeps asking to allow Bluetooth. I have said yes and later and it won't stop every time I open the app. So annoying
__label__podcast I will be in the middle of a podcast and it'll change to another episode of a different podcast.
__label__playlist __label__song_selection Even with autoplay off for similar songs, whenever I start playing a playlist it plays songs that are suggested and not from the actual Playlist.
__label__user_experience __label__bug Great when it works, haven't had too many issues on the Pixel 6 Pro. Control bar is missing with latest update.
__label__song_selection I Used to Love This app a Lot.... Many Amazing Songs and everything is so perfect 🙂😇
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__comparison Spotify is okay but I can't loop it or choose my song. YouTube let's me do that. I can do that on my computer Spotify but not mobile. It sucks.
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__advert __label__account Too many ads like gawd I know I have to pay for premium you don't need to give me three 30 seconds long ads continuously Even once is enough
__label__user_experience Since I updated the app won't open.
__label__account __label__playlist I love the app and the account prices are reasonable. The only problem I have is that it's a bit tedious adding songs to a playlist.
__label__playlist I really enjoy this app. The playlist is awesome!
__label__song_selection The songs are amazing
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__connectivity __label__user_experience __label__account Keeps saying no internet, when set to offline, when stuff I'm trying to play is downloaded stuff? Turn to online with my wi fi same gd thing? Worked great for years now this? Why do i pay for premium?
__label__user_experience The user experience issue was fixed and it is the great app it used to be once again.
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__playlist __label__song_selection __label__advert __label__account It's all about the money first of all when I want to listen to a certain playlist via artist or made by myself ,IT ALWAYS PLAY "SUGGESTED" SONGS. It so irritating because let alone I can't chose the song I can't get more than 6 skips an hour when it's playing song that shouldn't even be there . I liked it better when the subscription was unlimited skips and no ads 😌😌😌
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__advert __label__account Big fan, keeps doing really weird things like not showing that it's playing, unable to fast forward or rewind because I can't get to the song playing, gives me random ads and won't let me skip by them even though I have the paid version.
__label__advert Great so far haven't had to deal with advertising yet
__label__song_selection __label__playlist __label__audio_quality __label__advert Just a cash grab at this point, they stopped giving me my 30 minutes of uninterrupted music and I don't know why, I can only skip 6 songs (and it's extremely frustrating when a song I don't know comes on that I didn't put on my playlist) I can't even choose the song I want to listen to and the audio keeps skipping during the songs, just use an adblocker website and listen to music that way guys
__label__advert __label__song_selection There was like 1 billion ads and I didn't even get the songs I wanted
__label__song_selection It's a great app for song selection and, in my opinion, the best.
__label__advert Not having 30 minutes of commercials.
__label__song_selection __label__advert __label__user_experience __label__account __label__comparison Forget this. I'm going back to Youtube. At least there I can listen to the songs I want instead of my 30 ad free minutes being recommendations of what I listened to last week. 10/10 do not recommend this app. A lot of problems built into the app on purpose just to pressure people into buying their premium. Premium in their case being a decent app that just lets you listen to your music which I should get anyway. Total ripoff.
__label__song_selection Whenever I try to play songs it just plays a random song. Unusable.
__label__playlist __label__song_selection I try to play the song on my playlist and play songs I didn't add.
__label__account __label__song_selection __label__comparison Love this app but kinda silly how you have to pay to listen i mean seriously! I rather listen to my music on YouTube.
__label__podcast __label__user_experience I LOVE the more like this tab for podcasts! I love it so much I closed out the app and rated it after years of using Spotify 😂 definitely need more changes like this!!!!! Comment section next?? 👀👀👀
__label__account __label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__connectivity I started paying for Spotify but it stops playing. I don't have a clue why. Essentially, I am paying specifically for its ability to play in the background. But it doesn't. The play button just vanished. Also, I can't shut it down. It's unbelievable!
__label__playlist Plays songs that I didn't even add to my playlist.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection Works okay at the moment, but there's a slight issue where the genre slider at the top of the liked songs list cannot slide. :)
__label__song_selection Great app and music 🎶
__label__user_experience __label__advert ♦️♦️♦️♦️♦️🎴DONT DOWNLOAD Bad app for music it contains frequently ad 2:1RATIO OF ADS
__label__user_experience __label__bug Currently the play bar is disappearing from the bottom of the app constantly. Extremely frustrating and yet marked as resolved according to their website. Will be leaving 1 star review until this is fixed properly because it's a core feature that should never be broken (for an extended period of time at that) in a music app.
__label__song_selection Definitely a great app to have.
__label__song_selection __label__podcast __label__advert Very good app for song selection and podcasts. But adverts are too frequent.
__label__song_selection I love the selection of music. Oldies that I knew my granny loved that I couldn't find elsewhere.
__label__user_experience __label__bug __label__account __label__comparison Any other Android users having issues with the app? I've read a lot of us are experiencing the same issue after updating the app..once it's updated and you try to reopen it stays stuck on the logo....its trying to load up but never does! Extremely frustrating when you can't speak to a human. All Bots when trying to resolve the issue! Back to Pandora I go!😭😭😭💔💔💔
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__song_selection __label__podcast __label__account I love Spotify!! I have ALWAYS been able to find every song I'm looking for and every podcast too. Paying for premium is 100% worth it. Spotify is THE BEST app and I choose it over all the others out there. Thanks for being amazing Spotify 👍😁.
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__advert __label__song_selection __label__account Was terrible, couldn't stand using the app with ads and limited song selection... then I got premium. Now, all I ever use is Spotify. No ads, no taking up phone space, and pretty much all the music I listen to. Sometimes I have an itch for a song that isn't available on Spotify, so I just YouTube it and carry on with my day. The only account I won't be getting rid of any time soon :D
__label__connectivity __label__user_experience __label__bug Offline mode takes a while to respond, an issue that has plagued 3 of my phones (2x Samsung, 1x oppo many android update, app updates and years later still.
__label__user_experience __label__subscription_or_cost Too many problems not getting fixed! Anyone that pays should get a free month! 🤬
__label__song_selection __label__advert __label__account Everything is almost alright. Whenever I play my liked songs shuffled, after couple of my liked songs are played a little after you play song THAT I NEVER LIKED WHY PLAY THEM WHEN I HAVEN'T LIKED THEM. FIX THIS. Not only that every 10 minutes I get an ad. Don't bother me with the ads of not bothering you with ads for 30 minutes. THANKS FOR DISABLING MY ACCOUNT AFTER I WROTE THIS, everything was fine before I rated this.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__playlist Performance is very poor. When I search for songs and I tap the play button, it plays a different song.
__label__advert __label__playlist __label__comparison Great desktop version, free version on app is obviously worse. You get what you (don't) pay for I guess. Appreciate that ads are needed but there seem to be significantly more. That's a minor whinge. The fact the app throws random songs into your playlists is extremely annoying.
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__account __label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__playlist Changing my review from 1 star for the free version. I just got a student subscription and the app works super fast. I am able to listen to songs in different languages (a lot of them with lyrics). The playlists are also useful as I can discover new songs. Spotify has got to be the best music player in the world right now. :)
__label__advert Spotify was good until they started the 8 ads in a row deal
__label__podcast __label__user_experience __label__bug Constantly crashes with podcasts which is annoying. Plus the podcast video player could really use an update.
__label__song_selection Very happy, thanks A very good range of fantastic music Kind regards from Ollie from freezing Frankston 3199 Victoria lol
__label__account __label__bug __label__connectivity __label__user_experience __label__song_selection I tried logging in but I keep receiving an error message of "offline kindly connect to the internet" which Is very annoying because I'm very sure I'm connected to the internet.Not until I uninstall and reinstall and now I have to redownload my songs.
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__subscription_or_cost __label__account __label__song_selection __label__bug __label__user_experience I've been using and paying for Spotify premium since I was in 7th grade. I am now a college sophomore and thinking of cancelling my well-loved subscription because of the constant skipping of songs. I don't know why or when exactly the problem started, but almost every song skips like a bad record and I haven't found a single effective solution. reinstalling, reporting the bug, opening and closing etc etc. I love this app and I would hate to lose it, but this issue is incredibly frustrating.
__label__song_selection __label__playlist __label__user_experience __label__comparison New update is horrible. Not being able to pick which song and my playlist constantly shuffling. I recommend SoundCloud or YouTube Music.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience Great music app, only problem is that the song selection isn't actually random and it picks the same handful of songs each time.
__label__song_selection Best app in the world for music lovers1♥️
__label__song_selection Great music selection..
__label__audio_quality Voice is very clear and good
__label__song_selection App constantly plays the same songs regardless of using shuffle. For example, today while not driving the app is playing all the songs it played yesterday while driving. Sucks.
__label__advert __label__song_selection I will never pay for Spotify. It's a scam. Literally every other song is an ad and then when I am able to catch a commercial free period, you guys ruin it. How do you let a 4-minute song go over 6 mins and had I not used one of your skips my whole 30 minutes would have been wasted on 1 song. It's absolutely ridiculous.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience It plays every song I could ever imagine having to think of and it is very useful.
__label__user_experience Thank you Spotify, this is everything I needed.
__label__song_selection Absolutely Stunning! More like they know my soul and give me what i want. 🖤
__label__account __label__song_selection __label__playlist __label__user_experience __label__song_selection What is up with Spotify's free version. I understand that I won't receive the best version of the app but the 6 skip limit is frustrating. This becomes worse when you play a playlist and it randomly includes songs not even in your list. When you attempt to skip these, the app restricts you, even suggesting to edit your playlist. It becomes a problem because it's playing random songs. Furthermore, when conducting a song search, the system diverts to play more random songs.
__label__user_experience Use any other app. Constantly stops playing for no reason. Sometimes stopping after 5 minutes or less.
__label__song_selection The best app ever there is no song I cannot find here, thumbs up ,👍👍👍
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__bug __label__connectivity __label__account Loved it, but then the app started getting really buggy and now it thinks there's no Internet access when I can easily connect with other apps. Going to cancel subscription.
__label__song_selection __label__playlist __label__user_experience Its a great app but.. Since the new update spotify is just no💀 you can't even play your favourite song over and over why did you removed that in the app I don't know whose idea to put random songs in your playlist who EVER thought of that is a horrible idea.
__label__bug __label__connectivity __label__account Had to uninstall and reinstall for the second time due to years-old bug triggered by app updates when Spotify set to offline mode. Cannot login unless I do this.
__label__account Really great app I got what am paying for couldn't be happier 😊
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__account __label__advert Why pay for premium if there's still going to be ads every 7 minutes? Is there something more I have to do to turn the ads off??
__label__audio_quality Super sound quality
__label__user_experience __label__bug It's great n all but it has an issue when I'm using it,it only has the logo and it won't open I hope you guys fix this.😐
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__bug __label__account __label__advert The app has been getting more and more buggy and even with a subscription, I get pop-ups advertising in-app podcasts I have no desire to listen to.
__label__podcast __label__audio_quality __label__song_selection __label__connectivity Every couple of months the app's 'fun' side rears it's ugly head. I'm talking the sound cutting out for no reason till you open the app again, downloaded files that are in the downloads folder not playing till you're back on wifi or turn your data back on and the app not showing on your device that anything is playing when it clearly is. As we speak, Spotify started playing again randomly after cutting out for 10 minutes. Thanks Spotify.
__label__song_selection Literally can't live without Spotify. By far the superior song selection in my opinion 🤷🏼‍♀️😅
__label__user_experience __label__account __label__connectivity __label__bug Lol. Idk why did I bother to came here. The app doesn't work at all. It just show the logo, no matter how long I try to wait, and that's it. I can't even log in to my account. Tried to uninstall and reinstall for several times but it's just useless.
__label__song_selection I love the fact that I can listen to whatever kind of music I like!
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__playlist 100% satisfied with this app. We can search and hear any songs and make playlist. Love this app👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__account Even after paying for premium, it's not getting reflected.
__label__user_experience This app has changed my music experience. Thanks guys!
__label__bug __label__podcast __label__user_experience Constantly has player issues where it'll randomly stop playing and you need to reinstall to fix it. Just use the browser version instead.
__label__song_selection It really good but entire it was 👎 good because it didn't have the song on everyone time
__label__connectivity __label__song_selection __label__playlist __label__user_experience __label__account I've been having issues with connectivity, my phone doesn't allow me to play songs directly from my song selection. Edit: This has been an issue for almost a year.. half the time I can't play music from playlist unless I shuffle, it doesn't let me select individual songs. Not sure what I'm paying for at this rate. Tested on two Pixels and a Moto.. Edit 2: still broken two months later, collectively over a year. should i just give up??
__label__advert __label__user_experience Don't like the advertisements so much. Lately they've been getting lengthy with sometimes 5 in a row, which throws a wrench in my workout.
__label__user_experience Good for nothing this app is. They have to update themselves. If not nother Yahoo.
__label__song_selection __label__comparison Every songs are here best app like instagram and also BTS songs are here each and every
__label__connectivity __label__user_experience Could do better at loading when in offline mode since it's all already downloaded
__label__song_selection Love Spotify.. My music go to..
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection Very easy to use. Updated genre of music.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience This is a very good app to select songs and sing along with the help of lyrics.
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__song_selection __label__advert __label__account It is alright but as soon as the premium runs out it sucks because if you try to play a song you searched up you just get some other song instead of what you clicked on so basically you have to pay to listen to the music that you want also it now sometimes refuses to give me my six skips per hour because I used it yesterday and today used three skips and it said that I have used my six skips also not to mention it now gives me almost three ads in one ad and the thirty minutes don't work anymore.
__label__comparison Super super it's all no words Better than these app *gana app *Hangama * Jio savan Great work from Spotify.
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__advert __label__playlist __label__account Poor...30 seconds ads never felt like they last a long time till now. Especially when you're just trying to play music. I get that they need money...but bro...right in the middle of the Playlist? What's the point of listening your favorite song If an ad ruins your mood, hype and vibe just because you don't have premium.
__label__song_selection __label__podcast This app is a nice app for music and podcasts and there are my favorite artists.
__label__user_experience __label__advert This application has the worst user experience I've faced. Adverts are displayed after every 1 or 2 songs which is extremely annoying. I don't even feel like giving it 1 star but the review wouldn't get posted without it.
__label__user_experience I can't open the app : ( Tried installing-uninstalling the app multiple times already... still not responding.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection New update... Why shuffle play button disappear in liked songs? I want to get random music. There is only play/stop button and second button to loop playing. Please return it back!
__label__podcast __label__advert Best app for podcasts... best suggestion. but the adverts are annoying so Spotify make sure you reduce the amount of adverts.
__label__playlist __label__user_experience All good 👍. I can change even the cover of my playlists , What else do I need. But there should also be an option to turn off notification of any artist.
__label__user_experience Love it!!! Nothing else to say that would be better than "love it!!!"
__label__user_experience __label__bug After this last update the app won't even open on my phone, it's just stuck on the loading screen.
__label__song_selection __label__playlist __label__user_experience I loved Spotify, but the most recent update makes it where I can't pick what song is playing, and it just plays randomly and never plays music on my playlist anymore, if this is the new Spotify, I will be deleting Spotify and use something else, now I also can't see what is even on my playlist anymore, it just has a list and not a playlist.
__label__advert Tired of your ads 😑 uninstalling it😑
__label__song_selection Fantastic for music lovers.. On point!
__label__song_selection __label__playlist __label__podcast __label__user_experience __label__connectivity Y'all should add some features that will make the app incredible. One, add a feature that can allow users to play all offline songs. Two, add a supermix. And three, add two tabs on the home page that will say "music" and "podcast" it's time to separate music from podcast. Also, make it easy to download podcast episodes. I want to enjoy a podcast show without any pausing(buffering). Maybe auto download.
__label__song_selection Annoying. Stop shuffling my music!
__label__song_selection Great selection of classic period music from the sixties ...
__label__song_selection Awesome because now I can hear my favorite songs
__label__song_selection Doesn't let me skip recommended songs even when I had skips left
__label__song_selection smoothly find out all my favourite music
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__bug __label__song_selection __label__account __label__user_experience The app is not working properly. Downloaded songs were shown in library but do not play and now downloaded songs column is not shown on my library. I also bought the premium to download songs. Worst app I have ever used.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__connectivity __label__connectivity Best music app. The user experience of this app is very convenient, seamless connection with PlayStation and smart TVs.
__label__user_experience __label__bug __label__connectivity Failure to launch. Even after multiple uninstall and reinstall doesn't get passed icon screen. 0/5 stars not Samsung friendly.
__label__user_experience __label__bug App always going off lately! Very annoying. I thought I was the only one, but reading reviews here, many facing same issue.
__label__bug Keeps crashing when I open it.
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__song_selection __label__playlist __label__account It's a great app but you can't really choose the song you want to play and if you run out of songs that your playlist randomized, it just gives you random song that you might not even like and then pretty much forces you to buy premium.
__label__connectivity __label__bug So I was using Spotify for the last two years and now am having some issues. Whenever I get a message notification then the beep sound doesn't stop. No matter what I try the beep sound continues. I don't know whether it's happening because of a connectivity issue or Spotify has some bugs. Need an explanation if it's possible.
__label__bug __label__user_experience Amazing! I often have to restart the app to fix bugs but worth it!
__label__user_experience No matter what I do, it will keep playing. I close and it plays again.. damn stupid app...
__label__song_selection Goood all search enjoy songs
__label__comparison __label__podcast __label__user_experience Spotify is the absolute best music and podcast app Ever, I couldn't live without it now... Soooo much better than YouTube. The fact one can play a podcast in the background whilst doing other things on my handheld device makes it an absolute cut above the rest & the amount of free quality entertainment is mind blowing..Thank you Spotify xoxo
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__song_selection __label__advert __label__account Great app and amazing wide variety of content. Ads are not too loud or frequent in free use. Price of premium is very fair and totally worth it!
__label__song_selection __label__account __label__comparison __label__advert This app is great, it would be better if there was a feature to play the same song repeatedly, however, I believe this is a premium feature, which is alright. The app performance is impressive, rating it a 4.5. It surpasses Youtube music, especially in terms of advertisement frequency - on Spotify, you can spend an hour listening to music with hardly any ads interruption.
__label__bug Why the app always force stop... After few it will stop.
__label__song_selection __label__playlist I like the app but I hate when I try to find songs, they are shuffled with other songs I don't like and also my playlist.
__label__user_experience How do you turn it off when you're done listening,instead of just pausing???
__label__audio_quality Audio quality is very good 🙂😊😊
__label__bug __label__user_experience I've been experiencing bugs. The pause button won't appear. The interface isn't displaying properly when I'm playing a song. I keep restarting the app but it doesn't fix it.
__label__user_experience __label__bug __label__connectivity What happened??? I can't pause it anymore. When I play something I don't get any of the buttons showing up on my phone. I can't pause and it won't even show what I'm listening to. I've even had it play right over other apps like books. It's become complete garbage.
__label__user_experience __label__account I should have Given you 5 Star. But I rather give 3 star. Because Spotify is an excellent App. But the monthly payment is extremely expensive $9.99 .you guys should do like $5 .So to have many subscribers. e.g I'm 37 years old and if I will be listening to music for about 20 to come. How much will it cost in twenty years of my living on this Earth?
__label__user_experience When I was enter this app it's took more time to loading.
__label__user_experience __label__bug Why there is no previous feature in my application this also a updated version then why I don't have fix this issue fast................... As soon as possible ............🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
__label__user_experience App won't open. Just crashes
__label__playlist __label__song_selection Keeps playing stuff other than the playlist I created
__label__comparison Blend wins all the stars. I'd give one extra if I could.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience I love the Spotify service it gives me my choice of any song or album I want to play and I just love it keep up the great work
__label__audio_quality Good audio quality 👌
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection I love the download features, and the wide variety.
__label__song_selection It's the best app for music.
__label__song_selection __label__bug Its a great app. Its just that my songs aren't playing fully, So please fix this.
__label__bug __label__subscription_or_cost Gives me a blank spotify logo on a black screen when i try to log in, and has been "loading" for over 20 minutes. I'm paying 11.99 a month for this?
__label__song_selection __label__audio_quality Superb app with high quality music selection.
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__account __label__bug I really do enjoy using this app but recently there has been an issue that has been bugging me. Anytime I try to play music offline, some songs in the playlist do not play (I use premium). I would have to go online in order for them to play. I haven't had this problem before so I presume it's an issue from the app, it's quite annoying and I'd like if it's fixed.
__label__connectivity Need a very very very high connection
__label__comparison __label__song_selection __label__advert __label__user_experience I used to use YT vanced, it was a good app for BG music then i downloaded this, no doubt this is a good music streaming app but ads after every song?? One ad says that 30 mins interrupted songs and after that song again there is a ad, disappointed
__label__playlist __label__song_selection __label__user_experience How to remove the recommended songs on my playlist because I want to pick which song I should play first.
__label__podcast __label__song_selection __label__advert __label__user_experience It's a really good app with amazing podcasts and song selection that I loved but what made me give 4 stars is that after some time the frequency of adverts becomes too high. I hope improvements will be made on this and I recommend you all to use this app.
__label__podcast __label__bug __label__user_experience __label__playlist 7.5.22 App has been glitchy the last few days. Podcasts stop every 10 minutes. No control buttons, can't pause or back up. Normally this is fixed in short order but it's been too long. I mostly like this app. One ask I have is to make autoplay settings separate for podcasts. Depending on where I am when I select an episode, a new one may or may not autoplay at the end. I want autoplay for music but not for podcasts... please and thank you! Also shuffle available from the top of all playlists?
__label__song_selection I like this app cause I can hear every song.
__label__playlist __label__song_selection The daily mix is the same music every day nothing new. Don't now why they mix it every day with the same music.
__label__advert __label__song_selection __label__account It's an absolute issue against those people who don't upgrade their accounts... Because there are three long disruptive adverts after each and every track... I'll delete my account if you don't reduce those long ads after every song...
__label__audio_quality __label__song_selection __label__playlist Great for listening offline, Spotify offers clear audio and smooth transition between songs. It also recommends music with careful consideration.
__label__user_experience One of the best music applications I've used.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__audio_quality Spotify's good reputation is well deserved. Their recommendation system is first rate; the user experience is very strong and is regularly improved with updates.
__label__song_selection Nights with lovely songs is awesome
__label__song_selection It's great to be able to listen to a album of my choice
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__account __label__connectivity Will pause songs randomly if you don't give the app permission to run 24/7 in the background without restrictions on android. I don't want it starting or running in the background when I am not using it. It acts like I lost signal when using it if I have it as a sleeping app when not in use. I canceled my account because of this issue. Why pay for music that skips because you don't want it running all the time when not in use.
__label__user_experience __label__account Completely unusable app. Literally crashes when you attempt to launch it. Don't know why I pay for their service.
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__podcast __label__account __label__song_selection Podcasts do not play. I pay for the premium account, songs work but not podcasts.
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__account __label__bug __label__song_selection __label__user_experience Loved Spotify and have used premium, meaning I pay, for years now. HOWEVER, for at least two months now the app has been crashing, randomly pausing my music, and not showing any banner or display for the active audio. I've been very patient and stuck with an app I have appreciated, but that might change if Spotify does not fix these issues soon.
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__user_experience __label__account __label__playlist __label__bug I loved this app so much! I used it every day for hours and got premium. But recently my account won't let me play anything, and it changed the entire set up of my library, removing all my playlists. I tried to make another account and it's the same thing! I would be so happy if you could fix it! Because I love this app, I just can't play anything! (Problem solved! Thanks Spotify!)
__label__connectivity __label__user_experience More data it's taking 30 min 400 mb it took.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection One of the great apps for those who are good listeners, interested in music and songs.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__bug THIS SUCKS i literally picked eroplanong papel and other songs play like what? Spotify fix this and I'll give you a better review its really annoying you better do something about this!
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience Great music app. Only issue with it is that it sometimes stops. I have close it down and reopen it but this doesn't happen very often.
__label__podcast __label__bug __label__connectivity No controls visible anymore. (Play, pause, etc) My app will stop playing for no reason. This just started over the last few days. Without the play / pause option, I cannot pause my podcast or music when someone comes to speak with me. Additionally, the app keeps playing despite receiving phone calls.
__label__advert __label__song_selection Too many ads, not playing the correct song that I choose.
__label__song_selection Love it. Getting all my favorites.
__label__song_selection __label__playlist __label__account __label__user_experience __label__comparison Randomly skips my songs, won't let me pick specific songs in my playlist, literally missing basic functions you can find in 99% of other music players if you don't buy premium, they want to make it as mind numbing and painful to use their app as possible so you can give them money for something that others can give you for free! At least with youtube I can pick songs from my playlist to play without skipping through my playlist with shuffle.
__label__comparison Spotify rocks it, got kicked off another platform and don't miss it at all, thanks Spotify!!!!
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__bug I update new update of spotify then I open the app then my library is deleting my library song fix this issue
__label__playlist Love creating my own playlists!
__label__advert Happy but I don't need ads it's disturbing me
__label__user_experience __label__advert Awesome experience but advert is annoying
__label__advert __label__bug __label__song_selection An ad every other song, glitches all the time. Suggested songs are repetitive and annoying.
__label__song_selection Great music, good choice.
__label__user_experience Love this so far! 👌 i only use a few times a year....i just don't have the time.
__label__song_selection __label__playlist __label__user_experience I love it and hate it at the same time. I want to able to skip songs when it's an artists playlist. But other than that, you good.
__label__user_experience __label__connectivity __label__song_selection __label__bug __label__support My Spotify is not opening I am trying from so long but no response please fix this problem as soon as possible whenever I open it the logo of Spotify appears and it doesn't go for for so long I keep waiting that when will it open and when will I be able to enjoy the songs please fix this problem I want to use Spotify I haven't use it from so long
__label__song_selection I love the diversity of music. Real Caribbean rhythm.
__label__song_selection A complete app for song selection of favourite tunes.
__label__advert Way too many ads
__label__user_experience __label__advert __label__podcast __label__song_selection What has happened to this app? Where has the now playing screen gone? No way to control what's happening on the app anymore. I can't rewind, I can't skip the inbeded grifter ads by the podcasters or rewind and listen to something interesting.
__label__song_selection Full package when it comes to music
__label__playlist __label__user_experience Love it, been using it for a while, the liked song playlist is awesome, though I massively wish there'd be a 'relaxing' genre tab for sorting, if it does that in the future I'll easily give it 10 stars.
__label__user_experience __label__connectivity Poor user experience. You have to wait >10s for albums to load even when offline. Why does the app keep trying to connect when in offline mode and phone airplane mode??
__label__user_experience __label__account App is great! They should tell you though that after an update you should restart your phone, you know, just like your computer so your update can take effect!
__label__song_selection I shuffle thousands of songs and it's always the same 10 scattered at the beginning.
__label__song_selection This is the best app for songs.
__label__bug __label__user_experience Very buggy lately (July 2022). The app constantly bugs out, loosing the now playing bar and becoming unresponsive. The only way to stop play back is to force stop the app.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience Pretty good other than the queue option. When you want to go to the previous queued track, the queue gets lost for some reason and it plays a different song?!
__label__bug __label__playlist __label__user_experience __label__account Spotify has gotten extremely buggy in the last year or so. I will sometimes get redirected to a playlist radio when I try to shuffle play a playlist, and once in a while it pauses what I'm listening to and the now playing bar in the app and the control widget on my notification screen disappear. I've been a premium member for years and hope these problems get fixed soon, but it looks like they've been known issues for a while.
__label__advert __label__song_selection Way too many ads at this point I listen to more ads than music
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__audio_quality Nice app for music i can enjoy listening cuz most of the songs are available. But it will be great if lyrics were romanized cuz its difficult to sing along as an international kpop stan.
__label__song_selection Nice app all music
__label__bug __label__song_selection __label__account __label__user_experience The app keeps crashing, songs disappear, had to make new accounts cause it wouldn't let me sign in even if I changed the password and now it just won't open. I'm done, peace out!
__label__song_selection Great music collection
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__account __label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__comparison Extremely infuriating, I pay for Premium and Spotify wont even let me play the songs in MY playlist without playing a random "recommended" one, and there is no solution for this, and if there is they have done an incredible job of making the UI as confusing, cluttered and unnavigatable as possible. Unsubscribed, am now using a competitor, which is a lot better, for free.
__label__advert __label__account Really good, only problem is the advertising it does if you don't have Spotify premium, other than that a 5/5
__label__user_experience Overall, Spotify is a great app. But, as someone who has trouble falling asleep and likes to meditate, it would be great if the sleep timer could be set for more than an hour. - Suggesting a 2 and 3 hour option to be included.
__label__user_experience __label__connectivity The app is not working optimally, it won't load; it only shows the Spotify symbol and does nothing.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience Excellent selection of music and user friendly
__label__comparison I really like Spotify, much better than other music apps.
__label__user_experience __label__connectivity Not sure why there's no obvious way to close the app. It seems to want to run all the time. Not sure why I would want that feature? Uninstalled.
__label__user_experience __label__bug The app stopped working on Pixel 6 after the latest update. It's now constantly force closing.
__label__user_experience __label__bug It's been a month of waiting, I'm still looking at my screen a logo of Spotify how nice isn't.
__label__user_experience __label__connectivity __label__song_selection __label__account __label__podcast __label__bug What happened? Since July 4th the app won't work on my phone. It keeps stopping or shutting off completely and it won't play in the background. I used this app for sleeping and can't. There is also no way to skip or relisten to anything. Please fix! We pay premium and don't want to find another app for music and podcasts.
__label__playlist We can pick make our fave playlist
__label__user_experience __label__connectivity My play/pause options have disappeared. This is very annoying! Plus the app starts playing on my phone when I turn the car off. Which I can't stop because I don't have the control bar. Loved the app before this happened.
__label__user_experience __label__account __label__bug __label__subscription_or_cost Fix the shuffle "always on issue" I'm a paid member and doesn't even give me an option to unselect shuffle anymore. Frustrating doesn't even describe it.
__label__bug I can't open the app it only displays the logo. I tried clearing the data and cache but still doesn't work.
__label__connectivity __label__user_experience __label__account It's extremely annoying that I need an internet connection to view my "downloaded" content. That tells me that it isn't truly downloaded. In addition, the app will suddenly show that nothing is downloaded, and content is simply listed in my "episodes." Later, even though I haven't done anything and wasn't near wifi, it will show my content as "downloaded" again. Shouldn't the app actually download my selections to my phone?
__label__podcast __label__playlist __label__user_experience __label__connectivity It's good that you can use it for free and listen to playlists, also podcasts that you're into. The two issues I have are that sometimes (most times), I can't listen to the podcasts I've downloaded offline. Then the other is that you can't start a playlist from the beginning, a lot of the time you have to continue the playlist. I used to start another playlist then back again to start it from top but that has not worked in a while.
__label__song_selection Makes me fall in love with music again!
__label__user_experience __label__bug The play bar usually disappear even though I uninstalled and installed the app several times!! Please fix this.
__label__song_selection I really love to hear music on Spotify.
__label__user_experience __label__bug After this last update, my app keeps opening and crashing. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling but to no avail did that work. Such a shame because this would have been a 4 star review. I hope they fix this issue soon.
__label__song_selection __label__connectivity Great app to listening to all kinds of music without having to use YT and kill bandwidth
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__account __label__podcast __label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__bug I used to really love this app, so I ended up going Premium. However, for a few months now there has been countless problems. Music or podcasts constantly pausing, the bar where you can skip or pause constantly disappearing. I've contacted Spotify and done everything they've asked, but nothing works. I think they need to admit there is a problem with the app that needs fixing.
__label__song_selection __label__podcast __label__connectivity __label__user_experience I've been using Spotify for quite some time already. And in general it's cool. But recently I started experience problems with playing songs and podcasts in offline mode. And in general I have an impression that app became more laggy. Hope this is temporary.
__label__song_selection I always find the music that I'm looking for.
__label__song_selection Best music streaming app for free
__label__song_selection It's nice I can listen to my music
__label__song_selection Bangla & Hindi songs collection is so poor! Increase more songs.... 🎧
__label__user_experience shuffle doesn't work
__label__song_selection __label__podcast __label__user_experience #1 song and podcast platform for when you need some time out.
__label__account __label__user_experience __label__audio_quality SECURITY ISSUE. The accounts are not secure, avoid signing in with your email service if you cannot avoid using the app. Have been using it for almost a year to discover this. Your login information is NOT secure. Apart from that.. App is not upto the standard. Bells and whistles but no user experience quality. Low quality customer support for a paid service. The audio is very low quality, also the support executives have zero clue about their own product.
__label__song_selection It's got all the song that I like.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection Its real easy to hear a favourite song i like it
__label__account Good until the time i paid for the mini plan on Sunday but nothing happened 🙄
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection Best music app I really enjoy it when I'm depressed or happy. Anything anytime just Spotify. Music is the medicine for everything.
__label__user_experience __label__account bit disappointed. used to work great, but once I logged out wouldn't let me back in
__label__connectivity __label__account Whenever I get a new phone, it's difficult to log into your servers.
__label__playlist __label__user_experience __label__account __label__bug I accidentally pressed log out and now It's stuck at the logo screen. I've uninstalled and intalled it numerous times, cleared the data and cache and yet i still can't totally access the app. Please fix this, I can't lose my playlists there :(
__label__user_experience __label__connectivity What is this I open the app but the app not start I try all time i check my mobile network, then I use wifi network then I reboot my phone, but the app not start. If the app not work I uninstall the app and i say all don't download the app.
__label__account __label__connectivity __label__playlist __label__bug So I have the family pack which allows up to 6 devices and when I go to download my playlist it says too many devices (we only use 4) so I log everyone out and still same problem. Fix it now or lose a long time user.
__label__user_experience __label__connectivity __label__comparison Has lyrics, integrates better with Chromecast than the Google music service - seamlessly changing from computer to phone to tv, even automatically when I put my earbuds in. I am amazed how well this works. 11/10, it's the little things that matter and it's clear the people making this care.
__label__user_experience __label__account App won't go to log in screen, just shows splash screen
__label__advert __label__song_selection __label__user_experience Gave it 3 stars because it promises ad-free songs for 30 minutes and after every song, I'm shown an ad. This needs correction, or should I find another app? I had heard about 'karaoke' mode, when is it going to be launched?
__label__user_experience __label__audio_quality Break comes again and again, the mind is bad, that's why I am deleting this app, bad app is bad.
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__user_experience __label__account __label__bug It won't let me past the user interface with the logo. I have tried reinstalling, clearing data/cache, forcing stop, and restarting my device - nothing seems to work. Plus, I don't experience the special feature. So, I'm considering canceling my premium account.
__label__account __label__user_experience __label__bug Love this app been using it for like 2-3 years, but now I can't navigate the home page (like first page when you enter) and it would be cool if that is fixed.
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__playlist __label__bug __label__user_experience __label__account Now it stops when you open another app. Music keep randomly stopping this is on a playlist I have downloaded, also app keeps crashing AGAIN. I cancelled my premium because of the problems before. I can't see me keeping it as not much has changed, always problems.
__label__user_experience __label__connectivity __label__bug Usually love this app and works fine on my phone but on my laptop its a mess. It closes down within seconds of opening it, and doesn't want to work. Sadly its only the Spotify app which is giving me problems, I hope they check if there are some bugs soon :) other than that love the app.
__label__song_selection __label__account Spotify is pretty solid even though I don't listen to music frequently. However, I'm still waiting for a particular song selection feature I saw on TikTok, not sure if it's real or not, but I have updated my Spotify account already.
__label__user_experience __label__bug __label__connectivity __label__account Latest update is rubbish. The app is not even working at the moment. First issue was on my car, now the app isn't working on Android phone at all. Trying to reinstall the app. I pay for a functioning app, not this.
__label__user_experience __label__subscription_or_cost __label__bug Constantly randomly pauses, or doesn't let you press play at all. Terrible for a paid for service.
__label__user_experience Worst app I ever seen, too much problems. My recommendation, please do not download this app.
__label__account __label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__playlist First of all, I had to create a new account because the option for mobile login wasn't available. Now, when I play songs, either on shuffle or regularly, after each skip it returns to the first song I played, which is seriously frustrating.
__label__user_experience The best music app that I have used so far
__label__bug __label__account Please fix the bug, I cannot open Spotify since yesterday 07/4/2022. I really cannot access Spotify. Please help me or fix this issue, thank you.
__label__audio_quality __label__user_experience Sound is. So clear. Easy to use.
__label__playlist So far so good, I am loving the app. It makes collecting my playlists easy.
__label__song_selection Finally Spotify have put in lyrics if available, such a long time.
__label__user_experience __label__advert Good UI but too much ads. Mostly cringe ads.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__account __label__connectivity Had all my music saved to my sd card yet when Spotify updated I lost everything and it won't let me go back to sd card as it keeps trying to download to the phone. There is no problem with my sd card so I blame Spotify for stressing me out unable to use app now offline.
__label__user_experience Very easy to use, thanks 😊
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience The song which I want to listen is not played.For example I want to play lut gaye from Jubin Nautiyal.Other song is played but not lut gaye.Very sad.
__label__account __label__advert __label__user_experience __label__bug Amazing i would say I'm not a premium member but I didn't give it full 5 star because sometimes the ads are quite often to the point that there would ads after every song and other is that sometimes it just stops working it doesn't show me which song I'm playing so they fixed that i would rate it 5 star without being a premium member.
__label__advert __label__song_selection __label__user_experience For those who are tired of the ads provided by Spotify. Just simply download Spotify from a secure source, it's safe and secure and it's exactly the same as the original version you will never get ads and you can also download your favourite songs.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection New update sucks, I hate the add to queue option when I press on a song. Just play the darn thing.
__label__user_experience __label__bug So many problems with player, randomly stops, often doesn't show player etc
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience Great music listening experience. Would love an option to identify a song playing in the background.
__label__audio_quality __label__song_selection __label__user_experience I hate it because when I play a song I couldn't hear anything and if I download a song it keeps kicking me out of the app
__label__song_selection __label__advert It's a really nice app. Has almost all the songs which one could ever dream of. The only problem is too many ads. If maybe u could somehow reduce the amounts of ads for free listeners then that'll be great.👍
__label__user_experience Option of being able to just hide specific recommendation is just gone?!
__label__user_experience __label__bug The app is stuck on the loading screen, even after multiple uninstallation attempts.
__label__audio_quality __label__song_selection Extremely good quality music which gives justice to every music, whether it be jazz, rock, pop, classic etc. Very good correspondence.
__label__playlist __label__user_experience Love spotify cause I'm able to make my playlist and share it with my friends
__label__advert Too much of ads👎
__label__advert Welcome to the advert app
__label__podcast __label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__subscription_or_cost It keeps randomly pausing podcasts, it's not allowing me to play a searched song, and pause/pause button often dissapears which means I have to close app and start again. And all this using the paid version.
__label__advert Too much Advert
__label__connectivity If there is a power cut and when the power comes back and you try to play some music, it says no network connection.
__label__advert __label__playlist It's Good App Cx it has no adds and we can make our own playlists as well it's pretty fun
__label__user_experience __label__advert __label__bug __label__connectivity Well organised app but reason for 2 stars are 1.) Lots of ads after every 2 songs there's an ad 2.) Connected to wifi with avg speed of 10mbps still there's a network error so I have to close app and open again 2-3 times to try my luck
__label__song_selection __label__account For real bro... 6 skips an hour. We're putting limits on song selection now, how money hungry can you get.
__label__song_selection Very nice to listen to music
__label__song_selection __label__playlist __label__user_experience Horrible when you click on a song it doesn't play that song it plays a playlist and too make matter worse you can't even play specific songs on a playlist you created.
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__account __label__playlist Stupid app, borderline greedy. Forces use to use premium, or else you almost couldn't even listen to your album. Why the auto shuffle? No one needed that thing.
__label__user_experience I listen to it when I'm going to sleep, when I'm exercising, and even when I'm playing games by myself.
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__song_selection __label__account __label__audio_quality __label__user_experience __label__comparison can't really complain , except that sometimes it just stops playing music... this is honestly very irritating , i'm assuming it does this , because i don't have a subscription but all in all , i highly recommend it , good quality music edit : I canceled my subscription 2 months ago because I couldn't deal with the unwanted deductions every month. They still deduct money from my account and they are refusing to refund me my money. If you know what's good for you, you will download Apple Music.
__label__user_experience __label__advert __label__song_selection It's a good app but the ads are just annoying and I don't know why we get limited song skips per hour, it sometimes disrupts the mood. It would greatly enhance the experience if they could decrease the ad frequency and remove the song skip limit per hour.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__bug Since the new update, the user experience has been disrupted as the feature allowing pause or skip to the next song keeps disappearing. There is also a bug which causes a track to stop midway. I have tried reinstalling the app, but this problem persists. This bug needs rectification as it severely impacts the user experience.
__label__playlist __label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__connectivity The experience could be improved for offline mode. If I start playing a playlist that I downloaded already online, I'm unable to just continue playing it if I go offline. I must replay it from scratch, which is a problem if I was playing in shuffle mode. Please improve on that. Also, if a Spotify playlist is updated by just reshuffling tracks, songs don't need to be downloaded again if they've already been downloaded. Please find a way to just rearrange without downloading again.
__label__user_experience It helps me calm down and helps me play games longer.
__label__song_selection Great song selection.
__label__user_experience __label__connectivity __label__bug It has amazing options. But always encounters problems with loading, often displaying (no internet connection available), even though all other apps work absolutely fine with my current network connection.
__label__song_selection __label__audio_quality __label__connectivity Spotify is really no. 1 music app because I found it everywhere like Windows, MacBook, WebOS TV, Android and many more. I really loved it ♥️ And quality is also 1st class
__label__playlist Can listen to all my playlists and more.
__label__user_experience __label__playlist __label__account __label__song_selection Listen, Spotify is a great app, I've been using it for over 3 years, the people on here say 'it plays random songs not from my playlist' usually that is with a normal subscription. I highly recommend getting premium, if I'm not mistaken a family package is around R99pm.It is amazing and I really enjoy Spotify and their music!
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__user_experience __label__connectivity Lately the app doeasn't show itself and I can't control it like pause or play or close it. Sometimes I restart the phone itself!
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection Everything great other than the equalizer menu should be accessible on the homepage snd the app has some bad optimization or something because it opens super slow.
__label__user_experience __label__advert A dreamy app to experience your life with more beats & melodies whenever you want... Just adds are intruption and remindes me how poor I am.... 😅
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection I don't like how it's not working how it use to but it's an AMAZING app it's just I want to listen to a different song when a song is playing but it plays 10 seconds of the song I want to listen to.
__label__user_experience Just keep stopping for no reason. Have to force close to get it working again. 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__advert __label__account __label__podcast Too many adverts and more emphasis on buying premium, podcasts don't have ads so good.
__label__comparison This app is superior to all other music apps, an excellent choice indeed.
__label__song_selection __label__bug __label__playlist Queue related things have been bugging for many months. Songs randomly skipping and queue sometimes just wiping itself. Adding songs sometimes deletes other songs from queue. Really annoying as queuing is one of core functions.
__label__user_experience __label__bug __label__account Back then, this app was good and smooth. I've noticed some upsetting developments in the last several days. When I start opening my Spotify app, all I have seen is the logo. It's crashing and freezing at the same time. I've still thought of trying those Tutorials on youtube, but many of them didn't work. So I'm anticipating that this concern of mine will be fixed immediately.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__account Amazing I took off my Spotify from my phone expecting to come off like other apps but it did not I'm impressed if you love playing games while listening to music like me I really say download this app truly amazing.
__label__advert __label__song_selection __label__audio_quality Not too long of ads, can play psn and listen to music come from my headset.
__label__song_selection I absolutely love spotify. I can play any music I want for free.
__label__playlist Tracks are well organized.
__label__song_selection __label__playlist __label__user_experience Good variety of artists and playlists. User-friendly.
__label__user_experience __label__connectivity It takes forever to load know and ive never had a problem with it till 2 days ago. I have to exit out of the app and go back in multiple times before it will fully work...
__label__song_selection __label__playlist __label__bug I love being able to listen to my music, but lately I'll pick one of my playlists and it gets stuck on a black screen with the spinning green circle. Is this a glitch? I really want to listen to my music.
__label__podcast Spotify helps me reach out to podcasts and all interesting stuff all at once.
__label__user_experience My Spotify keeps crashing, please work on it.
__label__song_selection __label__playlist __label__user_experience __label__bug I have a Samsung A20 that recently had a software update and since then the app is completely unusable. My entire song selection is gone and I have no history so release radar and discover weekly along with other playlists are completely gone. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app several times. I tried going offline on both mobile and desktop and reconnecting hoping they sync. Logged in and out over and over. I'm annoyed to say the least. UI is version 3.1, android version 11.
__label__connectivity Pairs with the truck before start 🌄 drives.
__label__user_experience This app is not open I install 3 times
__label__comparison Spotify is the best music app out there!!! Yawl better get with the program people. Get Spotify now and try it for yourself, You'll love it too!!!! Spotify, the app to get!!!
__label__connectivity __label__song_selection Keeps telling me to check my internet connection. Can't play anything
__label__account This apps is not Good I cant disconnect to my account 😡
__label__user_experience
__label__user_experience __label__account __label__connectivity __label__song_selection Getting worse by every update so laggy and even tho i have premium i cant listen music when i dont connected to internet, my whole library wont update and be useable without internet even when i opened offline mode.
__label__advert 8/10 I don't mind adverts but certain adverts are annoying.
__label__advert __label__song_selection The waste app I have seen. They promise one ad every 30 minutes, but it's more like one ad every two songs. The least truthful app I've come across.
__label__account Overall, the app is really good. Knocking a star for the regular harassment to upgrade to a family account from the dual. Enough already!
__label__user_experience __label__account Love it #1 in my book. Been a user for over 4 years
__label__song_selection __label__playlist __label__user_experience __label__bug The last update broke the app, it stops playing randomly, doesn't show anything currently playing when there is something playing (no bar down the bottom or on the phone's notification Panel). Have tried uninstalling and reinstalling but to no change.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience If only all the songs I selected could appear on a single page
__label__advert __label__account So much add . and i don't have any interst of premium . please stop
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__account Best app for music and new discoveries. The recommendations to similar artists/albums, is second to none, a must though is membership. But worth every penny if you are a fellow music fan. Would give 100 stars if I could; Spotify has re-ignited my passion in listening to good, new (and old) music.
__label__audio_quality __label__playlist It offers good audio quality and you can also find incredible playlists in this.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience After being my favorite platform for music, I ran into trouble when I could not access the app on my phone after logging out.
__label__bug The app constantly crashes and is very buggy.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience When in stress I always switch to Spotify which is a magical song selection platform which makes feel more comfortable
__label__song_selection Best music app out there.
__label__song_selection I love listening to Spotify It plays the music that I love ❤️
__label__connectivity Beautiful sync between computer and mobile
__label__song_selection Great app with all the music I love!!
__label__connectivity __label__bug __label__user_experience Can't use the search option anymore. Keeps on saying 'No internet connection' while my internet works just fine. It's getting impossible to use Spotify with all these bugs. Please fix it.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__connectivity __label__bug I loved the app and listening to music for a while, but now the mobile app wont even fully load. Whenever I try to open to app, It stays on the icon screen forever. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling, clearing data, clearing cache, restarting my phone, restarting my networks, but nothing is working for me.
__label__song_selection I am happy by selecting songs with Spotify.
__label__bug __label__connectivity __label__playlist __label__song_selection __label__user_experience The apps keeps crashing anytime I try to make a Playlist, and even then I can't listen to a single song or podcast because "my internet connection is not responding" or something, it says as I play YouTube videos just fine. Even created Playlist appear to be empty. Every. Single. One. If I try to make a Playlist and it doesn't crash for some damn miracle as much as I add songs the Playlist it stays empty... and I really wanted to use this app, fix it or lose my money.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience AVOID THIS APP!!! you are better off listening to song on YouTube. I uninstalled it 2 hours after I installed it. You can search for a song but when you try to play it Spotify decides you really should listen to another. I searched for Should Have Been a Cowboy, song not album. I hit the play button and what comes out of my phone? Bubby Shot the Jukebox. Ok, I must have done something wrong so I do it again. I never did get this steaming pile of fecal matter to play it get correct song.
__label__user_experience Can't even start the app, I have to use Spotify lite.
__label__account __label__user_experience It worked and now it doesn't at all I pay for account just for it not to work.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience There are the songs which you can't even find in YouTube...One of the best music listening app ever
__label__advert __label__song_selection __label__playlist Too many ads....it's irritating. An ad between 2 songs can be the worst. Other than ads, you can find all the songs, playlists... I'm considering uninstalling it due to ads.
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__account __label__song_selection I love this app so much to be honest, though paying for premium is a bit steep and when I turn off my phone to listen to it same will the song selection sometimes but all in all I love this app so much, it's really great! :)
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection Spotify is the best app to listen to music!! 🤩🤩 but sometimes I'm always indecisive on the song I should listen to 😹😹
__label__user_experience For me, at one point it would just not load. For example, the Spotify symbol would just stay on the screen frozen, not doing anything until I just gave up on it.
__label__advert Alot of adverts
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__connectivity __label__account __label__podcast This app used to be great but in like the past year it's gotten to where it doesn't load. Even songs that are downloaded won't load if you don't have internet connection. I don't understand why I'm paying such a high fee n can't have my music and podcast.
__label__bug __label__user_experience Been running into a bunch of bugs recently. The most annoying is that I can't add more than one thing to the queue. If I keep adding, it will just erase the previous addition and I have to restart my phone several times to get it to work. Every now and then the control bar will disappear so I can't pause whatever I'm listening to even if I try from my headphones. Not to mention the random freezing and shutting down that has been more frequent lately. I've reported it before, never heard back.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience I like the feature that has lyrics but it'd be nice to have the option available to cast the lyrics to the same device I'm listening on.
__label__song_selection I love the songs it has different languages. It's... Perfect.
__label__user_experience __label__playlist The User Experience of the mobile app is subpar. Features like organizing playlists are not easily accessible, which significantly hampers the overall experience when compared to the desktop version.
__label__playlist __label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__bug Not sure what happened but for 2 days now, my mobile Spotify app hasn't been working. It's showing my playlists on the home page, but not in my library. Whenever I click on a playlist, it shows zero songs, so I can't play music on my phone at all. Fix this please!!!!
__label__user_experience __label__bug App gets stuck on the logo screen
__label__song_selection You can find all your music favorites....And still doing it Thanks
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__connectivity I really enjoy this app and kindly i be searching songs, that i have never listened for a long long time❤ thanks to this app neither it depletes too much data cost, but thanks😍🤙🏻
__label__user_experience __label__playlist __label__audio_quality Easy Interface....Personalised playlists...superb sound quality.
__label__playlist __label__user_experience __label__connectivity __label__song_selection I think it's a good way to wake up listening to something instead of a clock going off every morning. And it helps connect with family and friends also helps u get in a good mood or if u wanna sing with someone this is the number one app I recommend.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience The app itself isn't that bad, great selection of songs but the user experience with the shuffle feature is horrible.
__label__song_selection __label__connectivity __label__user_experience It's an absolutely great app for listening to songs, but only if you have a good connection. This app is unreal if you don't have to wait for music, but if you have weak connectivity and want to play your already selected songs, you're SOL, as you're going to have to wait for a better connection to play the songs on your device. This also applies if you're a service member with no connectivity overseas. You won't have access to your already selected songs at all.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection Years in and I still love it. Never a problem. So much easier than ANY other app. Love my music and they deliver. Thank you..
__label__song_selection __label__advert Plays music but ads are quite annoying. How many times does it need to tell you to use tide pods because they have less water than liquid detergents. Stupid ads between the songs. Uninstalled after three weeks.
__label__song_selection __label__advert They just removed a latest marathi film songs album which I was frequently listening these days. The claim of 30 min music without ads after a long ad is not right.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__account Spotify, you are the best for fixing it. I have lots of love. I will never stop using Spotify, my go-to source for music.
__label__advert __label__song_selection __label__playlist __label__user_experience __label__bug Good apps i wanna give 5 star but using this app longer and longer the ads come every 2 song after and says 30 min uninterrupted ads but when we play 3 song or more ads come again. Some song are unable to play. Last point when entering playlist it took time but when we turn off our net and enter the playlist it's fast... Wts does it mean?? Plzz fixed it
__label__song_selection Rarely have I looked for anything - rare, live, obscure...- that I can't find.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience Very grateful app for songs.. And also I suggest adding a feature to identify any songs, which can be especially helpful for identifying edited ringtones and songs. I believe many people find great music and songs through the 1 minute or 30 second edited status videos from WhatsApp, Instagram, etc... I hope you consider my suggestion as I really enjoy your app.
__label__user_experience __label__bug I can't open this year's wrapped before the app crashing two seconds into the first slide. Please fix this.
__label__advert __label__song_selection It's a good app for music, but there's a lot of ads and you can't skip more than six songs.
__label__bug __label__user_experience There appears to be more and more bugs happening every day. It's a shame the overall rating doesn't fully capture the current experience using the mobile app. Every issue I'm experiencing I can find in other users ratings.
__label__song_selection __label__podcast I really love it because I enjoy both songs and podcasts, and with Spotify, I get a vast selection of both. You can enjoy a range of podcasts such as horror, funny, sad and romantic stories as well as any genre of songs, ensuring an enjoyable user experience.
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__account __label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__audio_quality Since my Spotify got premium, my app was like it was possessed by a demon, it changed the songs by itself, adjusts the volume by itself, and distracts me by launching other pop-up screens when I am typing, just like a phone screen affected by water. The experience is not worth it at all.
__label__user_experience This is a excellent app to listen to.
__label__bug Ever time I played a song it would either play a song that won't stop playing unless I restart my phone or it would pause at random times!
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__account __label__user_experience The moment I paid for premium, the app ain't starting and getting hanged. Wasn't expecting this action from Spotify.
__label__user_experience __label__comparison The app doesn't load on my phone, but the lighter version does, as do other music players.
__label__song_selection __label__playlist __label__song_selection __label__audio_quality __label__comparison In the beginning Spotify was good but now it's the worst. I can't select the music I want, when I look for a song, it gives me a playlist with the same name but it doesn't even contain the song I want. Also, songs are not complete. When I play a song, it only gives a very short portion of it. Honestly, Sound Cloud is better.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience No replay option!! You can only listen to a song once!! Cheap app
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__account __label__bug WHY THE HELL DOES THIS NEW UPDATE KEEP MAKING MY MUSIC PAUSE LIKE EVERY 20 SECONDS. ITS VERY ANNOYING!! I DO NOT PAY PREMIUM EVERY MONTH FOR THIS. PLEASE FIX BUG!!
__label__podcast __label__account I stopped subscribing because you had a podcast that spread anti-vaxxer disinformation. If it's removed, I will reactivate my account.
__label__user_experience It's a pretty good app but I hate the update.
__label__song_selection __label__user_experience Definitely the best. Recommended for many more music lovers.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__advert Love this app. Whatever mood I am in, Spotify can satisfy my music craving. I just wish I knew how to stop my notifications from interrupting my songs.
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__song_selection __label__account __label__user_experience Love this app, I only use this for my music streaming. I pay for premium for my family and both my mom and I have been experiencing weird pauses and skips. For example, sometimes when I let my phone screen time out while playing music and it goes dark it pauses, sometimes it will come back on its own and other times I have to restart the app. It pauses other times too. It's a minor inconvenience but very annoying.
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection You're always updating. Stop. Get it to where it works and don't touch it. Every time you guys update there are problems... or maybe, I don't know, DO IT RIGHT. App is stopping again for no reason. And no, I don't want to uninstall and download all my music again.
__label__audio_quality __label__advert __label__user_experience __label__comparison The volume of music when using earphones is low but when the ads pop it will blow my ears and it has 2-3 ads in a row what waste of time I could just open my youtube app.
__label__podcast __label__user_experience This app doesn't let you critique anything; whether it be like racist or single-minded podcasts like behind the bastards or necronomipod. I find it quite humorous that such a large business could be so reckless when so many of their podcast creators destroy lives without little to any evidence.
__label__playlist __label__connectivity I can still access my playlists and play songs on the web browser, but through the mobile app, i cannot.
__label__song_selection __label__playlist __label__user_experience __label__account __label__bug Honestly love the app for release radar and unlimited music but I'm getting so frustrated that, for so long, random issues constantly arise. Adding a song to the queue replaces any songs in the queue, I'll have a queue and a new song I click will delete the queue, I'll click a new song and the queue will go to the next song instead of the song I just clicked, and out of nowhere after an hour or so spotify will just stop. I'm sorry, but if I'm paying, it's been months please fix these issues!
__label__advert __label__audio_quality __label__song_selection Love Spotify so much, only reason it doesn't have five stars is because there are so many ads. But, great quality and I love how I can find any song on here!!! <3
__label__playlist __label__user_experience __label__connectivity __label__bug It works perfectly fine before but starting yesterday it won't get pass the spotify logo sign for minutes then it would freeze and exit on its own. I'm missing my playlists already so please fix it!
__label__bug __label__user_experience Usually I use use spotify daily but recently there's been a bug and it just shows the logo when I open it and it doesn't work. I've tried doing things to my device to try and help it but nothings working.
__label__song_selection __label__advert I enjoy a mix of music with limited ads.
__label__user_experience __label__account For some reason still no access to lyrics unless I make a new account, which makes zero sense...
__label__bug __label__user_experience Great app. Sometimes glitches and the controls don't work so I have to keep listening without skipping songs. Normally good though.
__label__bug __label__user_experience __label__song_selection The new update sucks a fat one!! Pauses randomly, the player disappears and I can't pause/stop the music. Edit: after a couple of months, updates, re-installs, these issues are still happening. Very disappointing considering I have a pretty new high-powered Samsung galaxy.
__label__connectivity __label__user_experience __label__bug Jesus this is frustrating. Even though I force close this app several times, it immediately opens in my car and I can't get it to not connect. It is ridiculously frustrating. Borderline useless. I hope the engineers that worked on this get diarrhea and a cough for a week.
__label__user_experience __label__bug I like it but the new update is trash and it makes me want to get rid of it, please fix it.
__label__advert __label__user_experience __label__song_selection __label__comparison I mean I used to love Spotify but now it literally plays an ad after every song. Not only this but it constantly exits the app and stops playing a song for no reason. It also skips songs on its own. It also plays those ads that supposedly gives you 30mins of ad-free music if I watch it and when I do watch it, it starts playing ad after ad and it's annoying. I get you need to pay artists but the amount of ads played is ridiculous. Had to move to Apple Music, can't use Spotify no more.
__label__comparison Come on, its Spotify, it's the best music app out there.
__label__user_experience __label__audio_quality Excellent listening experience. You can listen to music with the screen off.
__label__playlist Like the playlists they set up for me based on the music I like.
__label__song_selection It's too good. All the songs I can ask for are available at one platform. I am loving it.
__label__user_experience __label__connectivity Easy to use easy to enjoy with my devices!
__label__playlist __label__song_selection It's good, but I'm begging y'all to show which playlists a song is in. For example, after you click 'add to playlist', there could be a mark next to the playlist name if the song already exists in the playlist. It would improve user experience by making organizing easier and less time-consuming. Please add it 😭😭
__label__account It's pretty good one day I'll pay the fee but not today lol
__label__account __label__user_experience Spotify suddenly logged out my acc out of nowhere and they wouldn't let me log in. It always says, "SOMETHING WENT WRONG, TRY TO USE YOUR EMIAL INSTEAD" but whenever I try to use my email, it always says "THERE'S NO USER FOUND IN THIS EMAIL" It's frustrating!!!! I just want my acc back???!?!?!???
__label__playlist __label__song_selection It's a good app but when I tried to play my own playlist I made it just starts playing random songs that I don't even like Spotify if you can make it an option to make it were the only songs in there are the ones we pick and not some random songs
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__account __label__playlist Spotify is one of the best choices for music that I can think of. I had premium for a year and that was really great cause I was able to make-up some fantastic playlists. And they don't erase them when you go back to free.
__label__song_selection Love it lots of great song selection.
__label__user_experience I'm not able to open Spotify.
__label__podcast __label__user_experience Definitely a great music and podcast app. Easy to navigate through the app.
__label__song_selection __label__playlist __label__user_experience I hate how it adds more songs to a single song and you just wanted to listen to that one song and it adds songs to your playlists too.Also why can't you remove songs?
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__advert __label__account Love this app. Wish I could work for Spotify, bet it's a real blast. 😜 The only issue I have is the ads. Can't afford to go premium just yet !
__label__user_experience I love that I can see all my favorites and much more
__label__connectivity __label__song_selection __label__user_experience When I connect my device to my phone and select a song, it just doesn't play that song, even when I am not connected to my device, very bad app experience.
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__user_experience __label__account __label__song_selection Used to be Great but now is not. When apps misfunctions one must delete all content to reset. No customer support exists-- just advice from other users. So to get the value of my Premium Subscription I must uninstall to re-install dumping my 1k song library 😞😓😩 07/22 no change. Review remains valid
__label__user_experience Please if you would provide us with a video player It would be fantastic.
__label__song_selection Love this app
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection 5 stars, for the most times. Some improvement could be done for car mode. Some songs are unavailable, but overall... It rocks 😊
__label__account __label__user_experience Spotify needs to add an option for redeeming a card from within the app itself. Currently, only credit card and PayPal options are visible, leading me to think there's a lack of consideration for users. Please introduce this feature in the app or else I'm considering discontinuing use. It shouldn't be difficult to implement this feature.
__label__bug __label__user_experience Constantly crashes on my pixel 6. Has so many issues where it plays music but I can't pause or stop it.
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__audio_quality __label__song_selection __label__account __label__user_experience I love this app, it provides the listener with a high audio quality and an excellent selection of songs catering to everyone's preferences. With a premium Spotify account, you have the additional perk of no ads and the capability to download your favorite songs or albums. Spotify also grows with you, tracking your music likes and offering a personalized user experience. 10/10 ' love it.'
__label__user_experience __label__song_selection Great user experience, however some great songs are unavailable. I know this may be out of the companies control but it does suck whenever I want to listen to a song only to find it is unavailable.
__label__advert Now ads bad app
__label__song_selection Why doesn't it want to show the songs
__label__user_experience Great can use a little work.
__label__song_selection Nothing else needs to be said... Finding artist I am looking for!
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__song_selection __label__user_experience __label__advert Great song selection, easy interaction with the app. Overall amazing experience and premium with no ads...just great!
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__song_selection __label__account Often times it's deleting my downloaded music even if I'm a premium subscriber.
__label__bug __label__song_selection __label__playlist Lot of bugs, One of them is when you remove (-) a song and press next(>) in playlist--- It skips next two songs and plays.
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__song_selection __label__account Very good app but I know they want to have money but it is somewhat frustrating to wait 1 hour just to change the song if you have changed it 6 times besides you can't choose because you have to be premium for Not having to listen to other songs and only listen to the one you want
__label__advert __label__bug __label__song_selection It's an Amazing app it's the only music app I use other than youtube. The only thing is sometimes the ad that gives you 30 mins uninterrupted listening bugs, But it's no big deal.
__label__podcast __label__bug Has anybody experienced the Mike Rowe's podcast freezing and not playing at all?.
__label__song_selection Reliable and loaded with the music I like
__label__song_selection Excellent song selection, a go to for any music enthusiasts
__label__subscription_or_cost __label__account __label__song_selection Even without a premium account I can still enjoy my song selection, it's a very very nice and enjoyable app.
